She slipped down the corridor, lump in her throat, skin tingling with excitement and pounding terror. Her footsteps, though quiet, thundered in her head as they echoed off the bare stone walls in the labyrinthine tunnels beneath the keep. 
Approaching a corner, Emlyn dropped into the shadow of the wall and stuck her head out to check the adjacent corridor. Two guards. 
Clad in bright blue uniforms with embroidered silver lining and fine swords by their sides, they appeared stood to attention beside a non-descript door. Had they not been there, she may have missed the room entirely, Emlyn thought to herself. But their presence gave away the prizes within. 
Stepping out, she took on her guise of the damsel in distress. If there was one thing all military men loved, it was having helping out an woman in need. Why, who wouldn't be thankful? And who knows how thankful she might be?
"Woah, stop right there!" the first guard yelled, stretching out his hand. "What are you doing down here?" asked the younger guard, in a friendlier tone.
"Thank goodness" Emlyn replied, putting on her most earnest voice. "I got lost, I have been wandering around for ages!"
"STOP! Not one more step, or I'll run you through!" the senior guard shouted again, putting his right hand to the hilt of his sword, as he pulled the sheath clear of his cloak with military precision. Still, the die was cast and it would take far more than two guards to dissuade her from carrying out her mission.
"Sorry", she said, almost crying, "I was just so scared".
"That's okay, but please stand right there, I'll get one of my colleagues will assist you", the guard replied, and moved his hand to put his whistle to his lips. 
She wasn't going to let him get off a summoning call, and by the time he knew to signal an alarm it would be too late.  This far below the Keep, she could feel only the tiniest shine of power from Meranis, but she had a phylactery with her that she had been charging all day. She triggered it with a tap and immediately felt the invisible glow burning on her skin. Drawing the power of Meranis into her chest, she darted forward with inhuman speed and punched straight for gut.
Winded, the soldier doubled over, trying to draw his sword, but it was too late. She whipped her knee up and felt a dull thud as her knee made contact with his head.
The impact was glancing and her fingers screamed for the wall, begging for purchase as she tried to steady herself. Her skin went icily cold and sweat burst out on her skin, her fear of death manifesting suddenly as she straightened back up to see the first guard slumped unconsciously on the floor, the younger guard staring down at him in shock. As he locked eyes with her he started backing away, his shaking hand going for his sword as well.
Emlyn almost felt sorry for him. Simply the wrong man in the wrong place at the wrong time. If he had been born in Verris he might have been someone she could have become friends with, perhaps one of the scribes or valet or any of the other young men that she would talk to in the Royal Gardens back home. She almost felt sorry for him.
She swung again, this time her left fist landing a solid contact on his forehead, his head whipping back violently into wall behind him. As he slid down the wall to join his fellow slumberer on floor, Emlyn turned, checking the corridor both ways, fearing the sound of charging guards coming to assist their friends. 
But no one came. As the adrenaline started leaving her body, her body started to shake and she crouched down taking deep breaths trying to regain her composure. With the adrenaline, the power that had been infused in her body started to fade and she started to feel her body start to ache. While, Meranis provided you with strength and alacrity, it wouldn't stop you from paying the price for your actions. She would feel the pain come tomorrow, but it could be worse, she could have been one of the soldiers.
Wasting no time, she slipped a key from the bag strapped to her belt and jammed it into the door the soldiers had been guarded. She held her breath as she turned the key, but the lock fell and she stepped into the dark room beyond.
Blinking, she started to make out the room she had worked so hard to enter. Simple and practical, the room of a clerk. The simple desk and drab tapestry on the wall gave no indication of why this room would need to be guarded at all times. Still, Emlyn knew better than anyone that looks could be deceiving. 
And there it was, on the centre of the desk in plain sight: a purple envelope with the red seal of Verris stamped on the back. She picked it up, stuffed it in her bag, locked the door behind her and headed back down the corridor the way she had come. Ten minutes later she was back in the bright sunlight, looking over the sea surrounding the city of Ren.

Emlyn couldn't help looking over her shoulder as she headed down the wide streets towards the docks. There was no way anyone could have seen her leave the keep. If they had, she would be dead now. Still, she couldn't shake the feeling every eye was staring at her. 
In the hustle and bustle of the market streets, there was no way to discern a word from the inhuman yells of those trying to sell their wares, all trying to outdo each other in  volume, if not in price or quality. She slipped through the throngs of people all jostling each other as they tried to make their journeys.  
Stoping only to dissuade a young pick-pocket with a gentle nudge, she headed down to the waterfront to the Apple Pony, the backwater inn she had left just two hours previously. The  smell of saltwater and the stench of too many people in one place filled her nose as she neared the inn.
Finally freeing herself from the crowd, she saw Orin sitting at one of the tables in the sun outside the front of the inn, glass of wine in hand with an empty glass beside the bottle itself.
"What took you so long? I almost finished this bottle by myself", Orin said humorously, a patronising grin gripping his face. 
Emlyn sat down next to him, lifted the empty wine glass up to her eye and look at him through it. "You're lying", she said quietly, trying to keep her face as straight as possible. "There is no way you could have known that I would be back so soon". They locked eyes, neither of them wanting to give away their thoughts. "That mean, that you have been waiting here for me to return, to mock me no matter how early I was", she said, placing the glass back on the table, not dropping eye contact for a moment. 
"What? Do you think I would play such juvenile games?", Orin replied in mock offense. "I am a busy man I will have you know Rosie, I cannot simply spend my entire day thinking of clever things to say and do to trick you people I will have you know!"
Her faced cracked and she began to smile. "Of course not" she replied as she slipped the purple envelope under the table into his outstretched hand.
"No matter", he said waiving his hand. "I have great news Rosie" he said, continuing his charade of happy indifference. "A letter reached me this morning" Orin said, pulling the purple letter out in plain sight for all to see. So much for discretion. "And I believe, it contains a great treasure! Shall we open it?" he inquired dramatically?
"Here Master Tomlin?" Emlyn said, somewhat surprised. "Wouldn't it be safer to address its contents in private?"
"Nonsense child, who would ever want to keep good news a secret?" he replied, opening the letter messily. "Why look at this", he said showing her the piece of paper contained within. "It seems to be the betting slip to yesterday's winning track horse. What great fortune! Who could have been so kind as to send me such a gift?"
"Who indeed? It would appear that you have some very lucky friends" Emlyn replied, sighing to herself about the shear obviousness of it all now. 
It now seemed so obvious that Orin would never have sent her on a truly important mission on her first assignment in foreign country. Hadn't everything been too easy? Only two guards, almost no security to speak of. She was starting to feel truly silly when Orin interrupted her train of thoughts.
"And generous", he continued. "Well, this truly deserves to be celebrated, let us raise a glass together" he said as he took up the bottle and started filling the empty glass.
"If you insist" she replied, holding her glass steady as Orin started to fill it.
"Of couse my dear Rosie, we are in Ren, not Verris. Why even a sixteen year old such as yourself can drink a little wine!" he said lightly. "Now come", Orin continued, "To good fortunes!"
"To Good fortunes" Emlyn replied and she started to sip her wine. 
Orin knocked his glass back in one full gulp and started pouring himself another glass. "Right, well it seems to me that we must be heading to the races to collect our winnings. And there is no time like the present, so let us finish off this fine bottle and be on our ways, we have a fine day of work ahead of us".

They were moving quickly through the streets, back towards the keep.  The cobbled streets were already starting to show signs of the detritus that builds up anywhere that sees thousands of people and animals every day.  Orin rummaged through his satchel as he walked, drawing things out apparently at random, with Emlyn a pace or so behind.  The bonhomie had melted away as soon as they got out of sight of the inn.
"It occurs to me darling Rosie," he said "that your efficiency in completing your errand may have complicated things."
"What do you mean?"
"In the years you've been running errands for me, you have learnt many things.  How many of those things would you say you used today?"
Emlyn dodged a group of children wanting to shine her shoes.  She didn't really know what he was driving at, so she stayed quiet.
"As I thought.  Let's come at this from a different angle. You completed your errand *skillfully* and quickly, correct?"  She nodded. "So, I am pleased with that. However, what is important to me other than efficiency?"
"Being the last at the table."
Orin barked a laugh. "Good answer. Yes indeed, being the last at the table. And seated at that table with us at the moment is our worst enemy." He paused in his flow to turn a corner. "Stop it!" he said suddenly.
"What?"
"You're imagining what he might look like." Orin spun suddenly, grabbing her shoulders and staring into her eyes. Even though she had known him for years and had seen him do this before, it still gave her the chills for a moment at how completely he had transformed himself with the things he had taken from the satchel as he walked. Only the slate grey eyes were the same. "I have not met him, you have not met him, but we know he's there, and he looks like the serving girl at the inn, or the market seller behind his stall.  If you ever do meet him face to face, he will look like whatever he wants to look like.  We didn't have to worry about him so much when we were in Verris, but now as I told you earlier, we are in Ren.  Quickly, tell me two things you would not want him to know about you."
"What I look like and where I'm staying."
"Both things that we don't want him to know, yes, but I'm thinking more fundamental.  Firstly, that you exist at all. Secondly that you are a *drinker*."  He almost hissed the last word.  "Over there is an inn that soldiers on the way back from their shifts occasionally have a beer in.  Draw your cloak around you, go in and sit in the corner on the left.  Don't let anyone see your face."
Emlyn had been waiting in her corner for only a few minutes before Orin came in with a young soldier.  They seemed the best of friends, although the younger soldier walked a little unsteadily and had a bandage around his head.  They sat at the booth on the opposite side of the room, but she found that by moving around a little, she could find a spot where the acoustics let her hear very clearly what he was saying.
"This? Oh it's not as bad as it looks.  I can't talk about it really", he was saying, "my officer told me that this stuff was all very hush hush."  He took a sip of the tankard he'd been given. Orin said something, to which he snorted.
"He was beaten up by a girl you say?  Some of them are surprisingly strong, as I've had reason to know myself.  Do you think there might be a girl planet drinker around?"
Orin said something she couldn't make out, but the sound changed.  She looked across, and saw the young soldier leaning away from Orin, his face contorting with fear.  She moved around until she could hear what Orin was saying:
"not dead right now is because your uncle whom I know to be a solid man vouched for you.  I don't think you understand the gravity of the situation you're in. There's not a man in this city who wouldn't kill you for the reward that would be placed on your head were they to know that you occasionally do jobs for me, and there's not a man in Verris who wouldn't kill you if they knew you were placing my mission here in danger through loose talk. If I have to come and find you again, it will be the last time.  Do I make my meaning clear?"
The young soldier seemed to have something wrong with his throat.  Orin stood up, slapped him jovially on the shoulder, and walked out.  Emlyn waited a short while then followed.
4.
----
Apparently scaring the soldier had lightened Orin's mood.  He whistled as he walked.
"Was that really necessary?" Emlyn asked.
"You tell me.  I didn't realise you had a phylactery, so I rather expected you to use a little more guile on that one, and if you had, that soldier probably wouldn't have needed reminding that he should keep his opinions to himself. What I hoped you learnt from that is that sometimes it avoids complications to use less direct methods, and the less that you reveal about yourself the better."
"How about the lesson 'if I want something done a particular way, I should explain that before sending someone to do it'?"
"Now *Rosie*, I'm currently in a good mood. Let's keep it that way."
She stayed silent for a while.  "So where are we headed?"
"To meet an old acquaintance of mine" Orin replied, "A real lowlife like myself who has managed to cut a life for himself here."
"Going to catch up on old times?" Emlyn asked
"Something like that. But if there is one thing I know about Ben it is that he always knows more than he should. And unless I am very much mistaken he will be in need of a little coin"
They headed along the harbour water, once again braving the crowds. Orin took long commanding strides towards his target. He slipped through the crowds, never once stopping for others, but no one ever seemed to notice him. His easy, elegant walk didn't ask for other people to let him through, he simply did. Emlyn hurried along in his wake.
Passing through the market the mouth-watering odours of freshly cooked fish and hot bread hit Emlyn. Suddenly breakfast seemed so long ago, and the wine was leaving her light headed. Fumbling for her purse, she acquired a couple warm loafs of bread.
"Here we are" Orin announced, approaching the grimiest pub that Emlyn had ever seen. The walls, presumably once white, were were water stained to the point where Emlyn wouldn't have been surprised if they had barnacles stuck to them. A heavily faded sign above the door announced that they were entering The Fish Wife.
The inside confirmed what the outside promised. The stench of vomit and sweat hung heavy in the air from the raucous party the night before and the endless evening of drunken debauchery before. Its current patrons were still sober, but come the end of their menial shift on the dock that evening, they would transform into a hailstorm of drunken slurs, wild threats and unskilled brawling. 
"Hey ho, Jacko" Orin exclaimed, throwing his arms in an embrace around a man who lifted him off the ground in a huge bear hug.
"So good to see you again old friend" the man replied.
Orin hadn't lied about meeting a lowlife. Everything about the man told of his daily battles. He was large; a good half a head taller than Orin, and twice, with arms which Emlyn reckon could have picked up a warhorse. With armour on. His face held so many cuts that it could easily have been mistaken for a map of a faraway land at first glance. And some of them were clearly fresh.
But despite all this, Emlyn couldn't help but feel affection for him. It was something about his smile, the way that it went all the way to his eyes. 
The man released Orin from his embrace, returning him to the floor, where they started shaking hands. 
"Gonna be sundown by the time you too are done greeting each other" said the barman sarcastically.
"Right you are Tom" <<Barmen are always called Tom>> said the man. "Please, two of your best beers and a…" he said trailing off as he made eye contact with Emlyn.
"Oh how rude of me" said Orin "Jack let me introduce Rosie, my niece. Rosie this is my old friend Jack"
"Hey who are you calling old?" Jack retorted "You are old enough to be her father!"
"Well yes, like I said, she is my niece"
"Well what will your niece be having?" the barman interrupted, pulling down the glasses off the shelf behind him. "And I hope she can pay for you all, I can't remember the last time Jack paid his tab"
"Come now, I thought that was water under the bridge Tommy"
"Beer down your throat more like. And not a copper piece to show for it" the barman replied
"Don't you worry, these are on me" said Orin placing a silver coin on the bar. The coin disappeared into the barman's hand so fast that Emlyn could have sworn he must have been a magician.
"I'll have a half" Emlyn said hopefully.
"You most certainly will not!" Orin said light heartedly. "What would your mother say? Why I doubt, she would ever let me under her roof again, if she heard I had let you drink!". 
Jack laughed good naturedly. "Go on Ben, just a half"
"Absolutely not, she will have cup of tea"
"'Fraid you out of luck mate" the barman replied. "Does this look like Queens garden party? Best I can do is water if the ladies not drinking"
"Water it is then".
They took their drinks and sat down at an empty table. They started talking about old times and what were they doing in Ren. Orin told the lies they had practiced so many times. Jacks eyes betrayed that he could tell something didn't quite add up, but he never said a word.
Once they had finished their drinks Orin leant his head in conspiratorially and started speaking in a hushed whisper.
"We are going to have a private talk, stay here Rosie, we will be back in a little bit" said Orin.
"Not a chance old friend", Jack broke in. "It has been okay while I have been here but the second I leave half this bar is going to start making a move on this beautiful flower of yours"
"I can take care of myself" Emlyn said defiantly.
"I am sure you can. But I am sure you two don't want to draw attention to yourselves" he said conspiratorially.
"He's right Rosie, why don't you go back to the market, we will meet you there in half a bell."
They left the pub and Orin and Jack headed into a back alley on the left while Emlyn slowly made her way back to the market.

5.
----
Emlyn wandered around the market, dragging her heels, trying not to look at everything too quickly and be forced to go around again. She couldn't help feeling slightly left out when Orin went off by himself. She understood the importance of discretion. Informants were a lot more open when they were talking to people that they knew well. And Orin would fill her in on any of the important details later.
But that didn't make it any less annoying. There was something about being a spy, you craved information, no matter how unimportant or inconsequential. And there was nothing more galling than being told that there was something that you couldn't know. 
Finding a low sea wall, Emlyn sat down and pulled a book from her coat pocket. A particularly dry account of the history of Kingdom of Kris, it's capital Ren and their countless wars against Verris. The historian was of course completely biased. 
The evil of the Kingdom of Kris held knew no bounds. While noble knights of Verris fought with bravery and cunning, the evil forces of Kris we sinful to their bone, raping and pillaging their way across the lands. 
But that was nothing to say of their King and Queen. A family so evil no one had dared challenge them for hundreds of years, for fear of their retribution.
The line between truth and lies were subtle. A man who is described a murderous warlord in one book, will be declared a defender of the innocent in the next. Both could be true.
Of course, whether they were good or bad, just or malevolent, didn't really interest Emlyn. Her years of training in the Royal Palace had drilled the importance of following orders.
What would happen if you told your arm to move, and it decided not to? Or if your one leg decided to walk and the other did not? To work effectively, your legs must trust the orders from your head assuring it that there were no cliffs ahead. 
Kingdoms were just like people. Your mines and farms were your legs, providing you with the your means to propel you through life. Your Armies were like your arms, defending you from others.
And she was the Eyes of the King. The Royal Spies provided The Crown all the information it needed to make the life and death decision the king made every day. Where armies were being marched, supplies being shipped, alliances being broken; all these were the coin of espionage. And of course, more valuable than all of these combined was information about Planet Drinkers.
Few in number, remnants of the ancient royal families, Planet Drinkers were ultimate weapons in hands of every royal family. Their ancient blood gave them powers beyond imagining. The power to fight, hide, <<blah blah>> on a super human level. Even a faintest whisper of a young prince being a Drinker would be enough for a battalion of spies to be deployed to investigate the claims.
Of course the history books had loads to say about the Planet Drinkers. How the unusual celestial order of the planets, the source of all Drinkers power, had allowed a previously weak nation to rise to extrodinary heights, before being destroyed as the planets moved inexorably along their paths allowing another nation to rise.
For Emlyn, being a Planet Drinker had never been much of a blessing. She supposed it could have been worse, had she been born in Kris, she would likely have been murdered, and her entire family with her if it had been discovered that a Drinker had been born so far outside of the royal line.
Still, in Verris drinkers were considered property of the crown, tools to be used, sharpened and maintained, to be deployed in defence of the kingdom at a moment's notice. 
She knew that she should be happy. To be placed in the House of Eyes was one of best outcomes she could have received. Provided as a precious resource, she was one of the only to Drinkers of the House. At the age of 6 she had been assigned to Orin one of the most accomplished spies in the kingdom. Tough not a Drinker, at 35 Orin was at the peak of his fame and power. Well, fame as far as spies could achieve; it was well known among the Council of Elders that Orin was the man to get the job done. But knowing that is strength would soon begin to wane, he knew that it was time to take on an apprentice.
Of course, she showed nothing but contempt to Orin when she first came under his tutelage. Young and scared, her 6 year old self hated everything and everyone; the kingdom for their unjust laws, Orin for his imprisonment of her and most of all her mother, for not protecting her.
Thinking about that time just embarrassed her. It now seemed so clear to her why things had to be the way they were. All things considered her life had turned out rather well. She was strong, fit and well taught. She was well thought of by the House and given ten years she could be the youngest person to ever be elected to the Council of Eyes. Her mother was doing well, and they saw each other often enough and, most important of all, Emlyn had a job that she loved.
There was nothing quite as exciting as trespassing where you weren't wanted. The thrill of game, the excitement of knowing what you shouldn't; it was unlike anything else, a drug that you couldn't duplicate. 
A sudden roar of noise jolted Emlyn from her thoughts. The crowd started boil as everyone started talking at once.
"They're coming. The king is coming!" someone yelled, nearly hysterical, running down the road, informing everyone he came across.
The people all stopped what they were doing and started to head to the road.
"You there, get off your ass and salute your King!", yelled a guard, marching through the market, following the path that the man before him had just taken.
Emlyn locked eyes with the guard confrontationally, before putting her book away and slowly started walking to the road. The guard stared her down, before continuing on his way shaking his head and urging other passers-by to head to the road.
She squeezed past the people to get to the front of the throng standing on both sides of the road. Following the examples of all the other citizens, Emlyn put her fist to her chest, saluting as the first horses of the royal procession came down the street.
It was a fine sight, twenty knights in full parade regalia headed the procession, followed by twenty of the kings personal guard. And then the kings personal carriage passed by. 
Painstakingly crafted, it glittered like a jewel in the bright sunlight. It had been carved to perfection, and covered entirely in gold gilt. Tiger motifs were present through-out the carriage, the official seal of Kris used to point where it became more vulgar than impressive.
The curtains were drawn; no doubt the king didn't want to see the dockworker, merchants, beggars and other lowlifes on his way to his ship.
As the carriage passed another twenty knights brought up the rear. Their searching eyes scanned the crowds, just waiting for an excuse to "deal" with someone who stepped out of line. 
One guard in particular stood out to her. He locked eyes directly with her. As he rode, his persistent gaze held her in place, and worry started to fill her. Did he recognize her? Had she been seen by someone in keep?
Emlyn felt a rough hand grab her shoulder.
"Hey" a voice yelled behind her
6.
---

“Ahhh”, Emlyn yelled jumping a foot in the air, her heart racing. Wresting herself free, she turned on her attacker, a look of fear and danger on her face.
 “Woah, calm down”, the man said, taking a step back, palms raised in a calming tone. He was handsome, Emlyn thought, and not as old as she had thought at first glance. In fact looking at him, he was hardly more than a boy, probably just a few years older than her. But his tallness and his manner made him seem a bit older.
“Sorry, didn’t mean to startle you” he said, reassuringly, “I was just trying to get your attention.”
Emlyn stared at him for a moment. She noticed that she was suddenly holding the power of Meranis, her instinct to save herself overriding her years of meditation. She took a deep breath, letting the power of Meranis leave her. “What do you want?” she said, straightening her hair unconsciously.
“Oh sorry, I just noticed what you were reading, ‘The Antiquity of Krisdom’ by Engust Dalson?’ he said questioningly.
“What?”
“Err, the book. That you are reading. It’s right there, in your pocket” he said pointing.
“Yeah so?”, said Emlyn coldly, still staring at him.
“Well, it is just so seldom that I see other young people intetrerseted in history. In fact, now I think of it, you are the only person I have ever seen read such a book who is under 50”
“What are you trying to say?”
“Nothing!”, he said defensively, suddenly becoming a little flustered. “I just thought it would be nice to talk to another young person for a change.”
Emlyn’s heart was finally starting to calm down after her scare. She knew she really shouldn’t feel resentment towards him. It wasn’t really his fault that she had been put on edge by one of guards. In fact, thinking about it, he hadn’t even really grabbed her that hard, she had just been so nervous that the slightest touch had sent her into a wild panic.
She took another deep breath, “I’m sorry, let’s start this again. My name is Rosie”
“Robert, good to meet you Rosie” he said, putting out his hand for a handshake, a look of relief on his face as she took his hand.
“So you like history do you Robert?” she said with a slight tone of mischief. “Well then, I am sure that you can tell me what the primary cause of the ‘Revolution of Adlard’ was.”
“Of course, though it depends upon which historian you put the most faith in.” he said knowingly. “Now as far as I am concerned Paler gives the most accurate account of the revolution, as he puts the primary cause to be Kings outlawing of weapon exports to the South Sea Islands.
The people of Adlard obviously being primarily metalworkers were hit very hard by this in a year where the crops failed. Suddenly finding themselves without food and with a surplus of weapons, the good people of Adlard decided that perhaps they were perfectly capable of governing themselves”
Robert’s had a perfect oratory voice, Emlyn thought as they walked towards the sea together. When he stated something, he made you believe it as fact. There was no doubt in his voice that was he said was correct. 
“So what do you make of Cheapers account of the revolution being primarily an idealistic one, brought on by a belief in self-government?”
“Bah”, replied Robert discountingly. “Cheaper is, as usual, simply pushing his own agenda, creating martyrs for his cause and evil warlords out of anyone who looked at him the wrong way.”
They sat on a bench by the harbour wall, looking back at the market, as the hustle and bustle of people resumed. Looking down curved wall, Emlyn could still make out the stiring pattern of people moving to attention as the Royal Procession passed by them. She wondered quite how a King got to be so revered so that everyone would drop what they were doing when he passed by. I mean, in Kris of course it was law. But it had not always been so. Once, the people of Kris had done so out of pure admiration. A national love for a single man who had done everything that he could for his people. 
Of course, eventually the king passed away and his son took over. Well, his son was a great man as well, why shouldn’t they show him the respect they had shown his father? And over the generations the sign of respect had become so ingrained in their culture that to not do it would be a sign of defiance. And in this age, no one defied the King.
“So yeah, as far as I am concerned, even then you should take Cheaper’s accounts with a great deal of salt” Robert said, clearly concluding his point which Emlyn had completely missed.
“Hmmm, well it definitely seems that you have an elementary knowledge of some history” she said defying his proud tone. “My turn”
They continued talking, quizzing each other on books they had read, their knowledge of ancient kings and queens long past and other minutia of history. Emlyn suddenly found herself laughing, feeling truly happy for the first time since leaving home. Rob had an easy going attitude, and a quick wit to boot.
Suddenly looking up she saw Orin coming down the street.
“Oh no, look at the time!” she said, looking up at the clock tower which looked over the harbour. “I’ve gotta go, I am going to be late”
“Wait, where can I meet you again?” Robert said, grabbing her hand suddenly anxious.
“Err, how about here? Tomorrow, at the sixth bell after noon.”
“I will be there”
Emlyn could feel Roberts eyes on her as she briskly walked in Orin’s direction. Silently signalling Orin to follow her, she ducked down a sidestreet and out of sight.
“Meet someone?” Orin asked.
“Just some guy at the market”
“Excellent. Well, I have some news. Best that we were on our way” Orin said, striding off towards their Inn, with Emlyn following close behind. 	


 

<Great sentences, need to go elsewhere>Those who drink the power of Meranis gain strength and speed.  It's said that Meran himself, with the planet at its zenith, lifted a fully manned warship out of the Strait of Kormon and hurled it ten miles. While such a story seems unlikely, there is no doubt that the ruined carcass of a centuries old iron ship still lies in the desert an hours ride from Kormon city.
Emlyn had never thrown a ship, but she had lived most of her life aware of the invisible burn of Meranis on her skin, and its power had saved her life more than once.  To be away from that shining was to be vulnerable, to be weak.  Of course, sometimes there was nothing that could be done. Once the planet sank below the horizon, only the few who had charged Planet Wells could feel the shine and the power.  The drinkers of planets further away, Persanis and Orthanis sometimes went mad when their strength disappeared below the horizon, unable to escape the knoweldge that it would not rise again in their lifetimes.<end>
