Prologue
---

The usual quiet and serenity of the palace had given way to the anxiety and fear that always accompanied uncertainty. The bells rang out loudly, signalling an attack, but there were no enemy soldiers, no conquering armies. 

Captain Jenkins, the first of the Kings Guard, rushed through the ornate passages, their usual pristine cleanliness dissolved into disarray. Whispers and shouting echoed through the hallways in equal measure, members of the royal household staring anxiously from their chamber doors and holding onto each other for comfort.

He passed couple of guards who were half way down the corridor, drawn away from their post the commotion. "Stand at your post!" he shouted, and they jumped backwards, retaking their position beside the door. 

"Oh Captain, there you are!" another soldier declared, in relief, forgetting all formalities.

"Lead the way Seargent Kyle", the Captain responded, putting enough emphasis in his voice to remind him to maintain his discipline.

"The King's chamber's Sir", he Seargent Kyle replied, and The Captain placed a hard look on his face and marched onwards.

They continued on, deep into the keep, towards the safest of places, the inner sanctum where the King's chambers lay. 

Where was the discipline?, The Captain pondered. These were meant to be the best of the best, the king's personal guard. And yet here they were, no one sure of what they should be doing, milling around like chickens with their heads cut off.

"I will have order here!", The Captain roared and each guard there stood to attention right where they were. He gave orders quickly as he walked onwards into the kings personal rooms. Once he had issued the undisciplined halfwits their orders, he entered the kings chambers.

He looked upon the room. Carnage. Everything in the room had been tossed aside, the clear and resonating signs of a struggle were clear to see. Vases smashed on the ground, one of the bed curtains had been pulled and now hung from one sad hook. Blood, there was so much blood. From the bed, to the floor to the wall, a thick trail of life stretched across the room.

And at the end of the trail, slumped against the wall: The King. He was covered in more than a few blade marks all along his left arm and face, and huge gouge sat in his chest, just below his heart. 

He must have fought bravely. The thought flashed through the Captain's head. At seventy years old, for him to fight back against an assassin's blade, when attacked in the middle of the night? There are some skills that a warrior never forgets.

But it had all been in vain. From the second the assassin had penetrated their defences the king had been dead. What did they do wrong? Not enough guards? Not enough walls?

There was no point second guessing yourself. The guard crossed to the bed and took up a sheet and covered the kings naked body with it, just as an old man barrelled into the room, out of breath, gasping.

"I am afraid that you are too late Doctor Virchow", he said as the old man entered. The First Doctor of the Realm looked so odd. 

His usual illustrious clothing, with velvet and golden thread embroidery were replaced this evening by a cheap full length shift of cloth. He wasn't wearing any shoes. Funny how something like that seems so odd at a time like that The Captain thought.

The surgeon crossed slowly to the king side, his bare feet wading into the large pool of blood around the king. He knealt down and put his hands to the back of his hand to the kings face, and then placed his palms all the way down his chest and to his legs. Finally coming to terms with the fatal truth, he sighed deeply and stood back.

The Captain placed his hand lightly on the old man's shoulder. 

"We knew each other since we were kids", the doctor said quietly. "My father used to bring me with him when he came to examine his father. We used play together sometimes."

"We will get whoever did this Rufus" The Captain said, but the old surgeon just looked away. They sat down on the bed, and the surgeon just looked at his feet.

"Sir", a guard said, standing to attention.

"Report", The Captain clipped.

"We have them sir, the assassin"

"Where?" The Captain asked, standing up suddenly.

"They are being taken to the cells as we speak. Found unconscious in the West Gallery sir, knife still in hand"

"Let's go" he said, and The Captain marched down towards the dungeons, as a group of apprentice surgeons charged past him to the king chambers, bags of equipment in hand. He could hear Rufus talking to them quietly as he marched to the dungeons.

As he walked down the wide passages of the royal keep, each of the guards stood to attention, showing the respect due the Captain of the Guard. Some of them looked so young, hardly ready for the war that was now inevitable.

It hardly seemed fair at all, being sent into the fray, barely more than children. But had he not been that age, even younger, when the last war broke out? Hadn't he done everything he could to enlist? To defend the kingdom and honour the king?

Somehow it didn't seem the same anymore, forty years had changed him beyond recognition. His many commendations for battles won and victories taken seemed a distant memory now. The events of another man's life.

But if it was going to be war, he was going to ensure that they were going to win. And the first step was to find out who was behind this heinous crime.

Descending the cold stone steps, the steel gates clinked open as he approached them. They were deep underground now, fires burnt in brackets attached all along the world, the only light in a world of perpetual darkness.

"The prisoner is ready for questioning Captain", the ancient jailor said, a toothless grin on his face, clearly eager to have a new victim to maltreat. 

"No one else has spoken to the him yet?", the captain asked.

"No sir, the assasin only just regained consciousness" the guard said, with a hint of laughter in his voice. "But I think you might find them a little different from what you are expecting Captain", he said, finding his key on his giant ring of keys.

The jailor turned the long key in the lock and swung the cell door open and the Captain looked in the door. Two guards sat either side of a table, and the prisoner sat, face down on the table, manacles snaking from the floor to the his limbs.

Sitting down at the table, the Captain loomed and slowly cracked his knuckles trying to be as imposing as he could. "So, we are about to have a little chat", The Captain said, nodding to one of the guards. The grabbed and the prisoners head yanked his head off the table roughly.

A sixteen year old girl, hair matted to her face with sweat, stared into The Captains head.

 Six Months Earlier

"Come on Emlyn".

The cry rang out clearly through the bright courtyard, as Emlyn hung tightly to the wall, trying not to look down at the flagstones that lay three stories below her.

She could hear laughter beginning to build from those watching from the ground below. She wanted for everything to be over, to be anywhere but here. But she only had two choices. Downards, towards those mocking voices far below, or upwards, where Orin's outstretched hand was just out of reach.

Emlyn thought that she could probably bear the ridicule of her peers, but the thought of disappointing Orin she could not. Not that he would ever say anything to her. He would just tell her how proud he was that she tried her best and that no other ten year old would have been able to do what she could.

But she wanted to do more than that. She wanted to make him proud of her, to exceed his expectations. Trembling, Emlyn slowly released the death grip she had on the windowsill and reached up, trying to find purchase on the the smooth stones of the wall she was climbing. Her legs followed her, and she let her body take over as she resumed the climb. She felt the rope around her once again begin to taughten as she was belayed from the ground.

Her body ached as she heaved her body up the wall inch by inch. Her fingers had gone completely numb with the exertion of trying to prevent her body from plummeting into oblibion. She took it one step at a time, keeping her training in mind. Her legs burnt as she stretched them out wide for a brick that was jutting out a little more than most, and pushed herself up on it.

And as she once again stretched out hand for a hold, she felt Orin wrapping his fingers around her forearm, and she was pulled onto the roof in one smooth motion. Emlyn could faintly hear applause from her peers far below.

"That wasn't so hard was it?", Orin asked, trying and failing to hide the huge grin on his face. For a master spy, Orin never did seem to be able to hide his emotions around Emlyn.   

She just stared at him, and tried to catch her breath. Her hands went to her waist as she undid her harness. She slipped it off, and tossed it off the side of building, where it promptly descended to take its next victim.

"Time to get up Emlyn", Orin said, as she took a step forward, heading for the stairs.

She swivled on the spot to look at Orin. "What?", she began to ask, but as she formed the words the world started list beneath her, her feet slipping as the roof started careening sideways. She crouched down, trying to keep her balance, as the roof started to pitch in the opposite direction. Orin simply stood there, seemingly oblivious to what was happening around him.

"Help me!". Emlyn tried to scream, throwing her hand out to Orin, but her words caught in her throat and her voice was silent. Orin was now completely oblivious to her very existance, his complete attention fixed, a one thousand yard stare into the distance.

As the roof once again rolled uncomfortably beneath her feet, Emlyn swung her head to follow Orin's eyes gazing into the great beyond.

The horizon burned, a choking fire engulfing the land, the smoke billowing up in a black curtain of dispair. She could feel the embers on her face, and she smelt her hair begin to singe in the billowing heat.

The screams of thousands rose up above the crackling furnace, as soldier's warcrys mixed with their screams, resounded through the air as they struck at each other brutally. 

"It's time to wake up", Orin repeated, his dead eyes surveying the horror with calm acceptance.

Emlyn tried to move, to scream, to strike out at the pain and suffering that was engulfing her. The heat rose, and she tried to shield her face, and she felt her tears hiss as they evaporated off her face in the searing heat. The fire had risen to a deafening roar, and the smoke stung her eyes, blinding her.

And suddenly, Orin's hand flew through the fire, and caught Emlyn's shoulder, centering her in the malestrom.

"WAKE UP!"

---

Emlyn sat bolt upright in her bed, arms scrabbling wildly looking for purchase. 

"Woah", Orin yelled as Emlyn locked onto his arm, her fingers forming a vice-like grip upon his forearm. "Calm down, Rosie."

Disoriented, Emlyn's head spun, taking in her surroundings. Her bed, the ship and her master. The cabin was completely dark, except for the dull light of a small lamp.

Emlyn's shift was drenched in sweat, and she could feel the knots in her back from her spasms. She wiped her hair away from where it stuck to her face, and took a few calm breaths.

"Sorry", Emlyn replied. "Just a bad dream". Orinn put the back of his hand to her head, and looking at her with a  small frown on his face.

"Meranis not up yet?", he asked, a look of concern on his face. Emlyn just shook her head, breathing deeply. "Okay, well it'll be dawn in a few minutes.  Take your time and meet me on deck when you are ready", he ordered.

As Orin departed Emlyn swung her legs off her bunk, touching the cold hard wood of the floor and held her head in her hands as she stared at the floor. The cabin was dark, illuminated only by the small lantern, and the dull purple halo of the first light of day, peeking through the porthole.

Her dreams were getting worse. Orin tried not to show it but Emlyn could tell that he was concerned. She wouldn't be the first of those with her gift to go insane. She felt sick to her stomach and Emlyn tried to gather her strength. 

While Emlyn may be sick and weak from withdrawal from an unseen force, Rosie was a young hale young lady with an energy for life. Emlyn meditated on her alias, taking on her second skin, and preparing for the day ahead.


The ship rocked lightly in the calm waves, and after just a few minutes later Rosie crossed carefully to her trunk.

Emlyn strained her eyes as she picked out a new set of undergarments and her best dress. She dressed quickly, and after a quick glance in her looking glass, she left the cabin.

---

The thin layer of mist started to disperse as the sun rose slowly over the bay, revealing the city beyond. Emlyn could just make out the streets and buildings covering the escarpment of the peninsula. The Royal Keep rose above all, a glimmering jewel of hewn white stone, sitting at the centre of the Rens, the Capital city of Kris.

Orders thundered across the deck, as the captain, strutted around ordering his crew to weigh anchor and head for port. The sound of stressed rope and fluttering canvas filled the air, and the ship lurched slowly forward, taking the stiff easterly breeze into the harbour.

Emlyn found Orin leaning on the port bow, taking in the salty air and fine mist kicked up by the waves. He smiled at her as she approached, still glowering miserably.

"Well don't you look like sunshine?", he asked cheerfully as sailors dashed across the deck, dodging around her.

"I'm not a morning person", she responded, smiling weakly. "But I am starting to feel better already".

Orin simply nodded.

The city grew steadily, and the roar of the first mate with it, who made swift use of his switch on any sailor he thought wasn't working hard enough, while the captain watched passively and adjusted his suit, making sure he looked his best. The men heaved, droppping and lifting sails, and guiding the ship slowly and securly to its dock.

The ship glided to a stop and in one smooth motion ropes were thrown to shore, and the massive ship was drawn into the port, a thousand parts moving as one, bringing their journey to an end.

The roar of dockworkers filled the air as Emlyn stared at the men standing on the peer, staring up at the ship and speculating wildly among themselves what goods there would be to trade.  

The sailor's abandoned their duties and leant wildly over the railing shouting down to their aquaintances on the dock below, and whistled to the ladies of the night who flaunted themselves eagerly.

The first mate was on them quickly and with much bellowing and liberal use of his switch managed to return his derelict crew to their duties. With much bellowing the ship was quickly prepared and a gangplank was dropped to the awaiting officials below.

With a big smile and hand outstretched, the captain descended down the narrow gangway to the dock below. The officials smiled and exchanged plesantries. Gifts were swiftly bestowed by the first mate, three large bottles of fine brandy, and they were invited upon the ship to inspect the holds.

And with the formalities concluded, it was time for them to depart.

2.

The carriage rocked lightly on the paved streets heading away from the pier. The coachmen cracked their whips and yelled eagerly at the teaming masses blocking their way to the inner city. 

The horses flung themselves forward eagerly as they trotted uphill along the wide boulevard and the maelstrom of people. Emlyn's head spun as she took in the babbling cacophony of rough speach and alien accents milling around them.

It suddenly occured to Emlyn how far she was from home. On the ship she had been surrounded by Verrisian men. As far as she had travelled she had never really left Verris, it had travelled with her. 

But now she was suddenly thrust into a very different place indeed. Though all civilised people now spoke the common tounge, the accents of those around her were so strong that she had trouble putting their sentences together. And their voices were loud and harsh to her ears. And they even smelled odd, no worse than the sailors on the ship, but most certainly different.

"Now remember Rosie", Orin said, disturbing Emlyn from her trance, "when me meet Lord Kepler, you need to present yourself with perfect propriety. Curtsy deeply, don't talk to him unless he asks you a question directly. Accept any food or drink that he offers. Basically just be a perfect lady."

Of course Emlyn knew all of this. She was perfectly practised in all the customs of Kris. Not that she would follow them too closely. It might seem a little bit odd to those around her if she didn't make any social gaffes.

The persona that she had painstakingly built around herself would tested to the limit as she entered the swirling whirlpool of court life. While Orin and she were posing as professional tutors, there would many rules and traditional that she would have to observe. In the Royal Keep etiquette and formality were more binding than law, and with stronger penalties.

The cry of soldiers rang out as they passed under the heavy gates of a massive guard tower. Emlyn looked casually out the window as they passed a veritable garrison of saluting soldiers in their bright blue uniforms. 

The carriage rolled to a stop in the middle of a well swept stone courtyard. The door swung open and a tall valet threw out his hand to assist Emlyn's descent.

Orin alighted without much fuss, and presented his official summons to the nearest servant, who quickly beckoned Orin to follow him. 

Emlyn fell in behind them as they climbed the steps towards one of the great stone arches theta led into keep. Dozens of soldiers stood by, ready to deal with any disturbance at a moments notice. Their eye's cut into Emlyn as she walked, and she fought to keep her anxiety down as she entered. 

Every terror of possibility ran through their mind. If they had already been compromised or someone suspected them of being spies, there would be no way for them to escape now. Well, at least not for Orin, Emlyn might have a chance.

Her heart hammered in her chest with every step that she took, but as crossed the marble floor of the entrance hall and were directed down a beautiful hallways, she started to relax.

"In here, Sir", the footman said, throwing wide the double doors of small gallery into which they entered. 

"Please sit", he continued, indicating a number of comfortable chairs and couches in the middle of the room.

"Will you require anything?", the footman asked.

"No. Thank you", Orin replied.

"Lord Tosca will be with you shortly", the footman replied as he withdrew from the room.

As the doors closed behind them, Emlyn fell into one of the chairs. Her hand ran along the beautifully carved wood onto the painstakingly covered velvet cushioning. Orin sat down in the chair next to her.

A few minutes passed as they sat in silence, Emlyn's eyes darting around, staring at the different painting and ornaments upon the wall, double checking all the furnishings in the room. Orin's face remained cool and collected as he stared at the door in front of them.

Just as Emlyn was getting restless, she heard foot steps outside, and with a creak the the doors opposite the ones they entered opened smoothly. A valet entered the room, followed by a tall, perfectly groomed, immaculately dressed man.

"Lord Edward Tosca", the valet announced in a practised intonation, and Orin stood up from his chair, Emlyn following his lead.

"Derin Tomlin, sir", Orin replied. "And my assistant, Rosie Garratt", he said indicating to Emlyn as she curtsied.

"Wonderful to meet you both", Lord Tosca said, a wide smile breaking across his face. He strode forward regally, his short coat tails swinging slightly with his movement, his arm outstretched for a handshake.

"You must be weary from your travels", he inquired as Orin and then Emlyn shook his hand. 

"I am alright, but I think that Rosie would like a chance to rest", Orin replied.

"Of course, of course", Lord Tosca replied, waving his valet over. "Please, make sure that Mistress Rosie is shown to her rooms".

"This way, Mistress", the valet said smoothly, and strove towards the doors. With a quick glance towards Orin, she followed after him.

"This way mi'lady", the maid instructed, indicating for Emlyn to follow. They had stepped into the beautifully decorated hallways of the back quarters, where the honored servants and minor nobles rooms where located. 

These rooms clearly didn't have the kind of splendor and workmanship of the front rooms that they had come through. But these halls still clearly outshone the most elegant corridors one could find in the House of Eyes back in Verris.

Clean wood linings edged the corridors and a beautiful red carpet ran along the middle and a clear bright light was thrown by the multitude of simple but beautiful chandeliers, evenly spaced along the ceiling. 

The walked for a significant distance, taking several turns, but remaining on the same floor. Emlyn made notes of all the doors and stairways that they passed, trying to fabricate a mental model inside her head.

"Here we go", the maid said, pulling a key from her pocket and throwing a door wide and inviting Emlyn to enter.

The room was small, but still exquisitely furnished, wooden panels throughout and tapestries draped upon them.  A double bed with hanging drapes was positioned against the wall and their trunks and cases were stacked tidiliy at the bottom of the bed. 

Emlyn intuitively made a quick count to make sure they were all present. She would have to inspect them more throughly to ensure that they hadn't been tampered with. 

A large desk sat against wall on the far side of the room, below a glass window overlooking the courtyard on the inside of the keep. Emlyn peeked out, gazing down upon the guards performing drills far below. 

"Your room is this way mi'lady", the maid said once again, indicating a door to the right of Orin's bed. "And the privy is over there", she said indicating the door opposite.

"Thank you", Emlyn replied as they entered her quarters.

The maid held out the key to Emlyn. "I have been told that Master Tomlin appreciates his privacy", she said. "This is the key for your room. The only other copies are kept by the Captain of the Guard and the King himself".

Emlyn's eyes darted around her room. As with everything else, this room was well kept. The walls were clean wooden panels, hung with simple but well woven tapestries and a fire crackled in the hearth. Emlyn's single bed was fresh and looked soft and comfortable.

"The servants entrance has been barred from the inside.", the maid continued, indicating a further door in the corner of Emlyn's room. "If you would like any service, simply unbar this door and pull upon that cord", she said waving her hand at the braided velvet rope. "We will also try the door three times a day to maintain the fires and so on".

"Thank you", Emlyn said again, returning to the main chamber, slipping the key into her pocket as she did so. "I think I can sort anything else out."

The maid curtsied and made her way to the door, before turning and saying, "Lord Tosca likes to entertain his guests well on their first night. Your master will likely not return until the early morning".

She took a deep breath before continuing. "I hope I am not being to bold, but you are welcome at the servants table if you would like some company", she said giving Emlyn a small smile.

"I am sorry, I don't think I got your name", Emlyn said suddenly embarrassed at her thoughtlessness.

"Mary mi'lady" *Get it, MAID Mary, lol* 

"Just call me Rosie, Mary. Thank you for the invitation. I will bear it in mind."

"Yes mi'lady" she replied, curtsied and left, closing the door behind her.

Emlyn sighed and fell face forwards onto Orin's wonderfully soft bed. It suddenly occurred to Emlyn that this is the first time that she had been truly alone for over a month.

Sure, she had her cabin on the ship. But there had always sailor's rushing up and down the corridors, their heavy boots clattering through the gangways. But there was still a lot to do.

Emlyn rolled over and returned to her feet and, with a sigh, got to work. She started separating their trunks and placing hers in her room. She unpacked her own bags and once she had finished unloading her clothes into her wardrobe and placing her few possessions upon her desk she returned to begin on Orin's bags.

Orin's bags were filled with a mixture of tools of the trade; Paper, pens, quills and ink. Two dozen books of translations, carefully wrapped in Orin's finer clothes to protect them from harm. Each book was carefully selected, procured from around the world at great expense to represent Orin's widespread travel as a caligrapher.

Emlyn stacked them neatly on below the window on the desk, next to the reams of fine paper, pens and pots of ink.

It was almost certain that they were being watched. In fact, it would be incredibly foolish for their employer not to have them observed, at least at first, for a royal scribe was privy to many secrets. Of course Orin would not be given secrets that weren't to be known within the walls of the keep. His primary job would be taking down the decisions of his lord, writing warrants and reading ancient histories.

Nonetheless, it would only be prudent for spies to be investigating anyone who was allowed inside their walls. For at every step one could find a charlatan who had weaselled his way to power through smooth words and would sell your small secrets to others for a few coin.

Emlyn and Orin had practised their business for many hours before and during their journey. They slowly and painstakingly became their characters, a perfect pair of master and apprentice tutors, outwardly seeming nothing more than overly obsessed teacher, soaked in words and letters.

During her training Emlyn had been taught about the secret of truly invisibility. The importance of discarding one's self, to become a character so absolutely, that eventually your own parents would have difficulty explaining to you who you actually were.

So, when it came time to prepare her masters rooms, she did not think of the secret mechanisms and encoded ciphers emaculately hidden in their bags, for of course, why would there be such things hidden in the bags of a scribe?

Instead, she did exactly as a young apprentice should, and ensured that her master's room was adequately prepared. Where there candles for night time writing? Were his reading glasses near at hand should he require them? Was his chair bestowed with a soft cushion?

And when her master returned, she would speak to him as befitted someone of her station, with respect and humility. And to all the world they would seem like nothing more than exactly what they claimed to be.

"You come very highly recommended among the Guild of Scribes", Lord Edward Tosca ventured as Orin let himself drop into a comfortable leather chair.

"Well, it is very nice of them to say so. I fear that they might say the same of every candidate they send to someone of your station.

Lord Tosca smiled, and a footman approached Orin with a exquisite crystal goblet upon a silver tray. "Brandy sir?"

"Thank you very much", Orin replied, retrieving the glass with enthusiasm. "To your health", Orin declared solemnly, leaning forward so that he was almost standing as he did so. 

Lord Tosca raised his glass as well, though he remained motionless in his seat. "And yours", he replied.

They both took a deep drink and a moment of silence fell between them before Lord Tosca continued. 

"So, I assume that have been fully informed of your duties here.", he inquired.

"Well, of course, my only duty is to assist you in any way I can and to the best of my ability", Orin replied, taking a sip of brandy. 

"But beyond that I have been told that my primary duties will be instructing your two young daughters in their studies", he continued, "Math, history, geography, language and of course, lettering."

"I don't think that you will find much problem with them. They are sweet girls, I can assure you that I keep a civil house and expect my daughters to respect their tutors as they would have them respect me", Tosca replied. A smile crept across his face as he continued, "Though if I know girls, that means we have only a few years of civility left".

Orin smiled politely in return, before Lord Tosca continued. "My wife looks after the children's education, and she will instruct you on the specifics that she would like you to cover, and how to do so.

 "Like all mother's, she can be very...", Lord Tosca paused, for a second before continuing. "particular, when it comes to her daughters well being. I suspect, that no matter what you do she will find something that she would like altered. Do your best to humor her".

"Of course, Sir", Orin acknowledged, keeping his voice flat. It was one thing for a Lord to criticise his own wife, but Orin suspected that if he ventured even partial agreement he would be likely to offend.

"This apprentice of yours...", Tosca inquired. "Does she also tutor?"

"Yes, Rosie is an incredibly bright young woman, Sir." Orin replied. "She is very knowledgable about the ways of the court and propriety. I think that your daughters will really like her."

"That is good. I sometimes worry that they don't have any older girls to look up to. All these city girls are spoiled brats. I would like them to have an intelligent person around."

"I am sure she will be an excellent role model sir".

"And what of her station?", Edward Tosca inquired. "Not that such things concern me much, but I suspect that there are some members of my house that will not want my daughters spending much time with commoners."

"She is a a minor noble of Verris", Orin replied smoothly. The cogs turned in his head as he sensed an opportunity.

When speaking with a nobleman you had to learn to read between the lines, and there was clearly a question behind the question here. Orin had never mentioned, or given any reason for the lord to suspect that his apprentice was a noblewoman. 

Yet clearly, Tosca hoped that she was. The lord in front of him clearly detected a chance to profit, depending on Orin's response. A noble ward within his house would be a powerful piece that Lord Tosca would be able to play. 

And if there was  chance for Edward Tosca to think he could profit then Orin definitely could.

"Both her parent's died in the Blood Plague about 10 years back.", Orin explained.  "Her relatives arranged for her to get a top quality education with The Guild, until she comes into her majority"

"How tragic", Edward Tosca said, with the smallest hint of sadness. "And her inheritance. Is it significant?"

"Hardly, at least not in monetary terms. But her title will ensure that she will be able to find a husband from among the rich merchants looking for a bit of status. So she has good prospects"

They both took long draws on their pipes, each thinking their own thoughts. Orin had sunk a hook, but whether he had caught a juicy trout or vicious marlin was as yet unclear.

Clearly Tosca was wondering whether there were any political advantages he could get by marrying one his family members into a Verrisian noble house. 

He probably considered a great fortune for this asset to drop into his lap, but Orin might be in a bit of trouble if he was now seen as a liability. If Orin let it be known widely about Emlyn's supposed nobility he would greatly elevate his status, and possibly cause problems for Tosca.

But there would be little that Lord Tosca would be able to do to Orin directly. No, instead he would try to divide Emlyn from him, offer her a better life full of the joys of the aristocracy.

Or perhaps, he would throw a young lieutenant from a friendly family her way. Try and seduce her with a sharp uniform and flattering words.

Either way, Orin liked having options. Even a bad choice was better than no choice, and the more choices that Orin got to make the better he could play the great game.

"Well, I am sorry about her parents. I hope that she can find a kind of family in this house", Tosca said finally. "And you as well of course"

"Of course. I am sure we will appreciate your hospitality greatly Sir"

Emlyn wandered the long twisting corridors, asking the occasional guard for directions before finally coming to her destination.

Faces turned to look at her, as she stepped into the large stone room that marked the servants dining hall. Emlyn's eyes scanned the long wooden table where servants of all ranks and masters say with meals in front of them, searching for Mary among the many faces.

A wave went up from the end of the table and Emlyn smiled widely as she made her way to where Mary was sitting.

"Over there", Mary said, pointing towards the corner of the room where a large bowl of stew was slowly cooling, with a stack of plates and cutlery accompanying it.

"Glad to see you came to join us", Mary said as Emlyn dropped into the seat next to her. "You look hungry", Mary exclaimed staring at the mountain of food heaped onto Emlyn's plate.

Emlyn blushed bright red and Mary let out a high, bubbly laugh. 

"I am just joking!", she said touching Emlyn affectionately on the arm. "I am sure you have had quite a journey!".

"Three weeks", Emlyn responded politely, starting to work on her food. "And nothing but ship's rations". She could feel many eyes on her and Emlyn just hoped that she hadn't made a fool of herself yet.

"This is Jake, Ben, Samantha...", Mary said, going around the table, oblivious to Emlyn's discomfort. "This is Emlyn everyone", she said once she had introduced everyone. "She is the apprentice of Lord Tosca's new tutor!".

A smattering of welcomes and greetings where directed Emlyn's way. 

"So good to meet you!", said Jake, who was sat next to Emlyn. He must have been in his late teens Emlyn guessed, and quite attractive.

"No, don't you even start Jake", Mary said leaning over Emlyn pushing the boy back with her hand as he laughed. "Don't you listen to this one Rosie. He is all sweet words at first, but it doesn't last".

"Hey, that's not fair!", Jake retorted. "Defamation of character!", he replied as he returned to his food.

The babble increased as everyone returned to their previous conversations. Emlyn studied each of her new acquaintances faces, and going through their names again. Orin would be most upset at her if she wasn't able to recall every name and face with absolute precision later. 

The food slowly disappeared from her plate while Mary chatted to her happily, with Emlyn returning the occasional comment to keep the conversation flowing. Mary didn't seem to mind Emlyn's quietness and had soon informed Emlyn of all the latest gossip in the keep.

The talk about town was all about the mobs that were forming in the principalities. Prince Alex Tyne, had just marched out of the city two days ago to quell the uprising and there were a lot of rumors flying across the table.

"I heard that they were led by giant tiger, who walks among the rebels camp and tame as a cat, but fights alongside them, during the battles"

"Prince Tyne is going to execute half of all the rebels to teach them a lesson about loyalty", another person ventured.

"Don't be ridiculous, if he kills half the rebels who is going to bring in the crop at harvest time?", another servant yelled. "I heard he was simply going to let his soldiers get the pick of their wives and daughters to bring home with them!"

A loud laugh went up from the table, and Emlyn quickly turned to ask Mary who Prince Alex was.

"Prince Alex?" Mary asked increulously. "Wow, you must have come far if you don't know who Prince Alex Tyne is."

Mary's unspoken question hung in the air, but when Emlyn didn't answer it Mary continued. "Prince Alex Tyne is eldest son of the richest family in Kris. After the Royal Anders line itself, of course."

Mary went on to describe Alex Tyne's wedding to Catherine Anders. The description that Mary gave was much different to the power grab that the Tyne family had made by marrying their inheriting son to the inheriting daughter of Kris. 

As Orin had said, she would be best to play it ignorant of current affairs, until she had a better understanding of the mood of those around her.

Mary seemed to imbue the event with some sort of otherworldly beauty, as though she was unable to fully express it in words.

"Of course, I was only a girl when it happened. It was about six years ago now. Anyway, he is probably going to be away for the rest of the summer. Which means that the keep will be quite a lot quieter."

"Oh?", Emlyn asked inquisitvely.

"Well, he has taken a good number of his best lords and each of them took a significant number of their personal guards. So there are far fewer men in the castle than we would usually have at this time of year. 

"Even in winter we normally have more people here. Less work for me to do, though I am sure they will find something for me to do."

"Indeed, well enjoy it while you can", Emlyn said, as she cleared the last morsels of food from her plate.

"I will do. Speaking of which, it is nearly time for me to get back to work.", Mary replied, as she rose from her seat. "The nobles will be making their way to dinner, and I need to go and restock their fires while they are out of their rooms."

"Oh, take me with you!", Emlyn exclaimed, grabbing Mary by the arm with an excited look on her face. 

Mary's face fell, momentarily and just as she was about to reply Emlyn interrupted saying,  "I left the door of my room open, and I bet it would be way faster to use the servant entrance than head back the way I came!"

"It'll be dark! And dusty, you will get your clothes all dirty!"

"I don't mind!", Emlyn said, trying her best to sound too excited to give in.

"Of course you don't! I am the one who is going to have to wash them!", Rosie said, with a mock offence, both of them breaking out in huge grins.

Mary looked both ways before, looking out for any potential witnesses to their crime before whispering, "Okay, but be quiet about it."

She beckoned for Emlyn to follow her as they left the dining hall, heading down the labyrinthian halls that made up the servants passages. 

Mary stopped along the way to light a candle and pick up a heavy pack of firewood, which she slung over her shoulder with surprising ease, before continuing on way.

With a final glance around, and after confirming that the coast was clear, Mary opened a small door and walked into the low stone corridor that provided the means by which the servants were able to travel unseen by those above their station.

Emlyn's mind reeled as she tried to map out the routes were taking, wondering how far she had traveled and how far she would have to go. 

They were hardly the dark catacombs that Mary had made Emlyn suspect she would be subjected to. The roof was low, the path narrow and the light from their candle barely lit their path. But the walls were made cobweb free and the floor had clearly been cleaned recently.

Left, right, straight on through the junction, left…

Emlyn's path back to her room, was significantly longer than it had taken her to reach the dining hall he first time. But Emlyn suspected that without having to walk with a heavy stack of wood, she could probably make pretty good time.

But beyond that, Emlyn marvelled at the massive advantage this route would provide her. The ability to travel between rooms without being seen by the eyes of the wary guards would be a massive advantage when it came time for her to start finding out the secrets hidden within these walls.

Of course, she would have to make sure that she wasn't spotted wandering these halls alone. Rumors among the servants of Master Tomlin's apprentice wandering around the servants halls late at night wouldn't do them any favours.

"Here we are", Mary announced, pushing on the door leading into Emlyn's room. Mary dropped the bundle of wood to floor with a crash and Emlyn followed her in.

"There we go, barely a mark", Emlyn replied, dusting off her dress automatically.

"That's a relief", Mary replied as she heaved the wood back onto her shoulder as she crossed the threshold into Orin's room and began stacking some of the wood next to the fire, and throwing a couple of the larger logs into the hearth.

"My master still isn't back", Emlyn said quietly.

"No, I suspect that he will likely, stumble in sometime before dawn", Mary replied, as she straightened up, making sure everything remained clean.

"That doesn't seem like Derin at all", Emlyn said. "I can't imagine ever seeing him drunk"

"It  is very difficult to turn down a drink from Lord Tosca", Mary said non-comitally. "I must be off now, I have many more rooms to get to"

"Thanks for everying", Emlyn replied as Mary made her way back to the servants door.

"That's no problem. If you ever need me again, just pull on the cord", and with that Mary slipped back into the darkness.

The darkened hallways of the Unbreakables Hold was not a place that The Captain of the Guard would want to find himself. How many assassinations had been planned in these dark corridors, how many lives deemed to dangerous to the realm to continue?

During the majority of his career he had looked upon the Guild of Royal Assassins, with disdain. While they undoubtably had their uses, her would much rather deal with the dangers directly, a sword in hand and with the law as his shield, rather than with a poisoned dagger in the dark.

And yet here he was. For the good of the realm he would seek out those which he detested, to follow the only course that was left to him and those he protected.

"Well, I have to say, I never thought that you would be coming to me with a plot to assassinate the King, Captain", the Unbreakable said, the eveil grin evident on his face.

"Moreover", he continued, "I never thought that I would actually be considering it.

"And yet here we are", the Captain replied.

"Indeed"

"But whatever you do, it must be absolutely unconnected to me, or anyone member of the Royal Court. It must be so water tight that even I believe that it was a genuine assassination"

"I assure you, it will be"

In the darkness, the Captain watched as the nameless assassin known only as Seven Hundred and Sixty Eight drew a wicked blade from within his robes with cruel efficiency. His mind reeled as he prepared himself for an attack, but his body did not even flinch.

"In older times, one would seal a bond like this with blood", the Unbreakable continued, hovering the weapon openly over his outstretched left hand.

The Captain, continued to stare, directly into his co-conspirator's eyes. He plumbed the depths for the last remnants of humanity, but came up short. He continued to breath in and out and his heart continued to beat, but beyond that the man in front of him was no more than a corpse as far as The Captain could determine.

For a space of three breaths the dagger continued to hover between them, a threat only thinly veiled behind a question. The Captain, steeled himself, holding his hand by it's side, as the anxiety grew in him, greater by every second.

Finally after a indeterminate eternity, the Unbreakable lowered his weapon.

"An old tradition. Probably best forgotten", he said said. "I must be about my duties"

"And I too", The Captain agreed, the blood slowly returning to his heart. And with that he  turned on his heel and left the forsaken place.

For the second night in a row, Emlyn felt herself being shaken roughly awake. The smell of alcohol hit her face in a thick miasma.

"Are you drunk, old man?", she inquired, throwing her her legs over the side of the bed and rubbing her eyes with her palms as she tried to gain her bearings.

"Hardly, but don't tell anyone, Eddy could drink the best of them under the table", Orin replied in a low whisper. "Event move without us, Rosie. Get dressed. And it's cold out tonight"

Emlyn suddenly found herself wide awake. She went to open her mouth in question, but closed it again a moment later and hopped out of bed.

As Orin slipped out quietly, she drew open her closet and slipped on her warm garments, covering her body from head to tow in fine wool. 

With the elements dealt with, she threw one of her trunks onto her bed, and with a bit of fumbling, coaxed the secret lock open. A panel at the bottom of the trunk popped open, and Emlyn reached in and pulled out a smooth dark, piece of cloth.

She threw the coat her shoulders, the dark material fitting her perfectly. She pulled the hood over head, where it obscured her face from the light, but allowed her to turn her neck and head without obstruction.

Reaching down into the trunk again, Emlyn pulled out a pair of gloves a thick belt, which she fastened around her stomach like a corset.

Orin, peeked his head in, and with a nod, she followed him.

Orin was dress head to toe in black. His coat hung tightly around him, dropping to the ground, stopping just short of his leather shoes, which were bound in cloth to dampen the sound of his foot prints. Black cloth was likewise wrapped around his head, obscuring his face, with his two eyes peeking out into the darkness.

"It appears that events move ahead without us", Orin whispered to Emlyn, offering her a black shroud which she started to wrap around her head, making sure to keep her hair out of her face.

"I have good reason to believe that our predecessor still lives", Orin announced. "But we must act fast if we are going to capitalise on this turn of events"

Emlyn's mind spun. When they had left Verris they were certain that their predecessor had been killed. The fact that he was still alive only brought more questions than answers. The possibility of a trap was high. Any information that Orin had been able to glean could have been left out intentionally for him to find, just in case he was a spy.

But Orin knew this, and if he decided that it was worth the risk, then Emlyn wouldn't argue. No spy got to Orin's age by taking unnecessary risks.

"So what is the plan?", Emlyn asked?

"We go to him. Now."

"And if we are observed?"

"Then we are already dead, and we have nothing to lose"

Emlyn nodded, as she wrapped the last piece of cloth around her hands.

"Meranis is just dawning", she whispered, feeling the warm rays rising above the walls of the keep.

"There are many Scryers, be careful not to be seen".

"I know", Elmlyn replied.

Orin drew the shutters of the window open and stared down into the courtyard below. One soldier was patrolling on his rounds, but his eyes never flew to the rafters where Orin and Emlyn would be making their move.

With a big step Orin positioned himself onto the windowsill and craned his neck to look at roof four floors above him, hooked rope in hand. With a big breath, Orin planted his left foot on the windowsill, and with his left hand gripping the frame tightly, he threw his body out over the cavernous expanse below.

With nothing but air below him, Orin started to hook in a short circle, slowly accumulating speed until the hook started to whistle and he released it in a  flying arc towards the roof far above him.

The hook sailed through the night air, pulling the rapidly uncoiling rope behind it. For a few seconds the rope continued to fly, but the inexorable pull of gravity could not be denied, and hook eventually slowed to a standstill and started to fall.

With a soft clink the hook fell upon the roof, and their hearts caught in their throats and they listened out for any cry of alarm or disturbance. But the cool night air remained quiet, and the guard below them showed no sign of concern in the pale moonlight.

Slowly, Orin started to pull on he rope and after a few hands, the rope caught against the  crenelations above them.

With a series of jerks, Orin tested the rope, but it held and with an outstretched arm he offered the rope to Emlyn. She took it in her hand, and after running it through a series of metal loops on her belt, she leapt over abyss.

The rough stone wall provided plenty of foot holds and Emlyn started to ascend. 

Her fingers caught the wall deftly and her back strained as she pulled herself up brick by brick, pulling the rope through her belt every few steps, before continuing up.

Emlyn's training had whipped her body into athletic form, and she scaled the wall quickly without loosing breath.

Finally hitting the top of the building she rolled over the crenelations and, after checking the hook was still stuck firm, she gave it a series of jerks to inform Orin to follow her.

The rope went taught as Orin began his ascent, and a few moments he threw his arm over the crenellations. Emlyn caught his outstretch hand and pulled him up.

After a brief pause to wrap the rope around his waist, Orin signalled to Emlyn that he was ready to proceed and began walk gingerly along the edge of the roof, with Emlyn in tow.

Under the clear night sky Emlyn could see full majesty of Kris. The city flowed from the palace, the buildings covering ever inch of the city right down the ocean upon which the small fishing boats could be seen rocking on the waves.

In the darkness the city seemed to take up a romantic air. The lights from the lamps and fires within the gave a warm homely feel to a what would be turning into a chaotic miasma of business in just a few hours.

The a cool sea breeze blew inland, carrying the smell of brine, clearing Emlyn's head and bringing on a certain feeling of nostalgia for days long past.

With a sudden halt Orin threw up his arm, indicating for Emlyn to stop. With a intense look Orin pointed down to the courtyard.

Emlyn's breath caught in her throat.

"I think that you will find that my daughters are a truly wonderful pair", Lady Tosca informed them, pacing around the study in which they were sitting. She flitted between the globes and maps, the extensive library and the tools of geometry stacked on shelves throughout the room.

Emlyn had never seen a such a beautiful room of learning in all her life. It was more of a  Library of Everything than a class room. 

The sheer size flummoxed Emlyn. There must have been desks for thirty or more students, but the majority of the space was taken up by large variety of subject areas. Maps and Glboes in one area, portraits of kings and queens, and their accomplishments in another. There was a massive collection of stuffed fauna and pressed fauna in one corner and for those missing from the collection there were endless folders of painstakingly prepared illustrations.

A massive window let in the morning light, which flooded over a massive table, used in the illustration of historic battles. Hundreds of little figures, stuck in a state of perpetual battle. The Battle of The Pine Soldiers, Emlyn spotted on the page of the book illustrating the battle in progress.

"There is no spite or malice in them", Lady Tosca continued, interrupting Emlyn's thoughts. "And you will find them ready to learn"

"I am sure we will", Orin replied.

Bored… Gonna add some action!

Emlyn slips out when she has a spare chance and starts investigating their predecessors room, which has been locked up. Adventure!

The previous spy, Derrik, was a minor clerk in the treasury. Emlyn and Orin are here to retrieve any of the notes that he left behind and return them to Verris.

This will require them to live for an extended amount of time in Rens trying to find the books that could not be found by the inquisitors of Kris.

Why do they have a chance of finding something that no one else could? Because the previous spy and Orin were rivals during their early days. No one knows him better, how he thinks, what he does, where he hides.

X.

Emlyn didn't find anything concrete, but an off hand thing that she mentions gets Orin thinking…

Emlyn meets the Princess. She is really interesting, and she makes Emlyn a proposal of some kind. We like her.

X.

Orin does something secretly without telling Emlyn or explaining to the reader… Hmmm, what is he up to? A note of intrigue left at the end of the chapter.

X.
---

Cut to: the Scryers, far away, day time.

Turn's out they are investigating a series of serial (redundant?) killings being perpetuated by a rogue planet drinker. We learn a little bit about their personalities

X.
---

We get to se a short chapter of the Unbreakables plans, possibly with the Captain of the guard in tow, but probably not.

X.
---

Back with Emlyn and Orin now. Apparently Orin's clandestine activities have paid off and he has a good clue. They find their predecessors safe house, in which there are a series of ciphers, but not the item they are looking for. Frustration!

X.
---

They start trying to break the ciphers, and thinking about every way that they can possibly bring this flying dutchman of a mission to an end. Orin is having some serious doubts about the mission, but tries to hide them, but Emlyn can tell.

Meanwhile, Emlyn meets Robert. Not really sure how deep into the relationship we want to get. Emlyn never forgets that the mission is her number one priority, but even so…

X.
---

Princess gets back to Emlyn with her initial proposal. It is going to tough to balance everything and things start to slip…

X.

Cut back to the Scryers, they are up to something or other, more character building.

X.

Plot event! Emlyn breaks the cyphers and discovers that it was actually a Verrisian the whoel time who was trying to precipitate war. Wow, everything makes sense. But wait, it's worse than that! It appears that there is a mole inside the House of Eyes who is leaking information, and people are on the look out for spies. They are hunted now...

Turns out, it was at the Princesses orders that her father was to be killed. She was doing it because, the danger that Verris posed was too great!!!

LEGACY COMMENTED OUT

<!---

11.
---

Under the cover of night Emlyn and Orin made their way through the fog filled streets, not quite skulking, but clearly not wanting to be seen either. 
Meranis was in perfect conjunction, directly above their heads, where the power flowed directly through her like a torrent, made all the worse by knowing that it would be slowly shrinking over the horizon as the night gave way to morning.

"Allright, let's go, Orin whispered, pointing up at the top of the tall wall surrounding the Treasury. Standing two feet away from the wall, Emlyn bent down and cupped her hands together, giving a stand for Orin to place his right foot in.

"Ready?", Emlyn asked. Orin swallowed grimly, eyes closed in silent prayer to the god's he didn't believe in before he opened them and gave a short nod.

Emlyn tapped the power of Meranis, opening herself up to the power of Meranis, allowing the the unspeakable euphoria to overtake her momentarily. She gave a massive heave with her arms and sent Orin whistling into the air. Her breath caught in her throat as she saw Orin reach his peak and begin to fall, before he landed noiselessly on the top of the wall and she began to breath again.

Soaring through the air, she glided gracefully onto the wall, landing lightly on of the crenelations and giving a little bow to Orin.

"Okay, well, then onwards we go" Emlyn replied, as Orin started to unwind the rope that he had wound around his stomach, which had anchored him to Emlyn in flight.

Orin took the rope and tied one end around the crenelation before offering the other end to Emlyn. Took the other end, wrapped it twice around her hand, and then leapt into the night.

She flew through the air lightly, perfectly pitched to carry her gracefully onto the inner keep of the Treasury.The roof rose up to meet her and she landed lightly on the copper tiles.

She let herself slip down the sloped roof until till she reached the edge and she leant her back against one of the stone gargoyles. She took her rope, pulled it taught and began to tie it firmly around the stone gargoyle. 

After checking and rechecking her knots in the dim nightlight, she gave three tugs on the taught rope and felt three tugs come back from Orin. Letting go, she rested against the Gargoyle until twenty seconds later Orin came looming out the darkness, striding arrogantly across the rope.

As he came to the top of the roof, Emlyn stretched out her hand and pulled Orin to safety.

"Excellent, now to find an entrance"

Tying another rope around the Gargoyle, Orin started to repel down the side of the building. After a brief scuffle with one of the windows, the shutter popped open and he swung inside. Emlyn waited ten seconds, before wrapping on of her legs around the rope and following.

In the dim light of the room, Emlyn looked around to survey it's contents. It seemed like some abandoned storage coset. Judging by the thick layer of dust in this room, no one had been here in quite a while. Years, perhaps decades, had come and gone, and no doubt those who had once known what was supposed to be held within had moved on, taking their secrets with them.

Endless reams of paper, ledgers and books stood in endless stacks, filling the room from wall to wall, just enoguh space remaining to walk narrowly between them to retrieve any old document. If there was any kind of system, it was a mystery to Emlyn. The faded writing gave no clue as to what their contents contained.

"Want to give this one a go?" Orin whispered, inviting Emlyn to unlock the door that would allow them access to the corridor that would take them to their objective.

Emlyn knelt down beside the door and slipped her toolset out of her bag. Peering at the lock she started to gently riggle the long metal implements, encouraging the lock to open.

There waws something very satisfying about opening locks. The finesse of it, knowing just how much pressure to use, and where. Too little and lock would not turn, too much and the lock would jam and you would have to start from the beginning again. Not much different from people really. Just a study in pressure and patience. Compliance was just a matter of time.

But this lock would not comply. Everytime she thought she was near, something odd would occur and she would be forced to start from the beginning again. And Orin's sigh's from behind weren't helping.

She tried every trick she knew, but everytime she got a little bit closer, she found something that would just not give way. Finally Orin put his hand on her shoulder and she withdrew her tools and stood back to let Orin try his luck. Although, Orin would of course say that it would only take pure skill when he did it.

While Orin drew his own set of finely crafted lock picks from his belt Emlyn wandered the room. Orin swore that he had won the lock picks from a giant in a wrestling match, or was it the present for rescuing a nobleman's wife from a band of raiding savages? There was definitely tall story behind how he came into a set of lock picks inlaid with pearl and gold. Although he no doubt stole them from some unfortunate mark or other. Irony was never lost on Orin, and he no doubt took great glee in stealing from a would be thief.

Emlyn found herself looking at the ledgers and books that stood in their towering stacks in the room. Most were the typical boring sort, reports of one lord's complaint against the other. Taxes too high, too many raiders attacking the merchant fleets, one nobleman's daughter seduced another's son and was now trying to get him to name the bastard as his heir.

Most of the reports were written in the common tounge, painstakenly copied out in smooth clear script, quill and ink engraved with expert precision. Others were written in some kind of cypher, their keys included on a loose paper between the cover and the first page. Being consigned to this room was the only action needed to ensure that they would never be read again.

The lock clicked and Orin peaked through the crack in the door.

"All clear", Orin informed her. "That lock was a real nightmare, was just about ready to ask you to smash through near the end there."

"Seems like someone predicted someone might try to do what we did", Emlyn replied, concern in her voice.

"Hardly. More likely no one ever wanted those documents read. No doubt one hundred years ago those secrets would have been most valuable. The grave has taken the men and this room has taken their secrets. Lets be on our way. Remain silent."

They snuck out into the corridor and Orin leapt off into the darkness, Emlyn following on fleet footsteps behind him. There is a trade off between speed and silence, and Orin rides the knife edge, skating along the dark stone corridors, never making more than the faintest of footsteps. 

Emlyn felt like a lumbering beast, as her quiet steps, sending thundering echoes off the bare stone walls in the labyrinthine tunnels inside the Mint.

Orin put his ear to a heavy wooden door before pulling it wide to find a winding staircase leading to the murky depths of the levels below. He turned around, winked in the dim light of the corridor and flew through the door, Emlyn following just steps behind him.

Emlyn regretted closing the door immediately, as the suffocating darkness enveloped them. Emlyn stuck her left arm to the wall while her right groped into the still air in front of her. She found Orin, their arms wrapping clumsily around each other in the pitch blackness.  Orin slipped his arm down hers until he had Emlyn's hand in his. He gave a brief squeeze of support and pulled her as he headed down the lightless stairs.

Emlyn held on tight, rushing headlong into the hellish depths, certain each step would be her last. They dashed step after step, leaving their secret entrance miles above them. Emlyn thought about the long journey that still lay ahead of her, having to travel back up the steps to make good their escape.

Finally Orin, slowed to a stop and after a brief pause said "Do you hear that?". 

Emlyn held here breath and in the deep silence, heard a faint metalic sound. Mechanical. A crashing and crunching of too many moving parts.

"The mint?" she asked, her voice bouncing off the walls in the darkness.

"Indeed" Orin replied, "Now we will what is going on here." 

Orin swung the door open slowly and quietly as the small light of the mounted torches struck their tender eyes.

"Lets go", Orin said, releasing her hand and slipping into the corridor. Emlyn followed.

12.
---

Drawn onwawrd by the ever increasing volume of the grinding machinery, they dashed through the passages in the Royal Mint. Emlyn was totally lost now. She wondered how Orin was able to keep himself oriented, trying to shut out the terrible thought that maybe he didn't.

Emlyn wasn't even really sure they were above ground anymore. They had traveled so long and so far that she wouldn't be surprised if she was in a different country entirely.

Orin waved her to a stop, and she leant against wall, trying to blend in with the shadows. Orin was leant against wall at an intersection. He poked his head out and snapped it back and fixed his gaze on Emlyn.

Two guards. Twenty yards down the corridor. Armed. Orin signed all the information she would need in a series of sharp, precise hand motions. Emlyn nodded.

Approaching a corner, Emlyn dropped into the shadow of the wall and stuck her head out to check the adjacent corridor. 

She slipped down the corridor, lump in her throat, skin tingling with excitement and pounding terror. 

Clad in bright blue uniforms with embroidered silver lining and fine swords by their sides, they appeared stood to attention beside a non-descript door. Had they not been there, she may have missed the room entirely, Emlyn thought to herself. But their presence gave away the prizes within. 

Stepping out, she took on her guise of the damsel in distress. If there was one thing all military men loved, it was having helping out an woman in need. Why, who wouldn't be thankful? And who knows how thankful she might be?

"Woah, stop right there!" the first guard yelled, stretching out his hand. "What are you doing down here?" asked the younger guard, in a friendlier tone.

"Thank goodness" Emlyn replied, putting on her most earnest voice. "I got lost, I have been wandering around for ages!"

"STOP! Not one more step, or I'll run you through!" the senior guard shouted again, putting his right hand to the hilt of his sword, as he pulled the sheath clear of his cloak with military precision. Still, the die was cast and it would take far more than two guards to dissuade her from carrying out her mission.

"Sorry", she said, almost crying, "I was just so scared".

"That's okay, but please stand right there, I'll get one of my colleagues will assist you", the guard replied, and moved his hand to put his whistle to his lips. 

She wasn't going to let him get off a summoning call, and by the time he knew to signal an alarm it would be too late.  This far below the Keep, she could feel only the tiniest shine of power from Meranis, but she had a phylactery with her that she had been charging all day. She triggered it with a tap and immediately felt the invisible glow burning on her skin. Drawing the power of Meranis into her chest, she darted forward with inhuman speed and punched straight for gut.

Winded, the soldier doubled over, trying to draw his sword, but it was too late. She whipped her knee up and felt a dull thud as her knee made contact with his head.

The impact was glancing and her fingers screamed for the wall, begging for purchase as she tried to steady herself. Her skin went icily cold and sweat burst out on her skin, her fear of death manifesting suddenly as she straightened back up to see the first guard slumped unconsciously on the floor, the younger guard staring down at him in shock. As he locked eyes with her he started backing away, his shaking hand going for his sword as well.

Emlyn almost felt sorry for him. Simply the wrong man in the wrong place at the wrong time. If he had been born in Verris he might have been someone she could have become friends with, perhaps one of the scribes or valet or any of the other young men that she would talk to in the Royal Gardens back home. She almost felt sorry for him.

She swung again, this time her left fist landing a solid contact on his forehead, his head whipping back violently into wall behind him. As he slid down the wall to join his fellow slumberer on floor, Emlyn turned, checking the corridor both ways, fearing the sound of charging guards coming to assist their friends. 

But no one came. As the adrenaline started leaving her body, her body started to shake and she crouched down taking deep breaths trying to regain her composure. With the adrenaline, the power that had been infused in her body started to fade and she started to feel her body start to ache. While, Meranis provided you with strength and alacrity, it wouldn't stop you from paying the price for your actions. She would feel the pain come tomorrow, but it could be worse, she could have been one of the soldiers.

"Nicely done. A little scrappy, but not too bad I think." Orin said, walking up to her. Emlyn just crouched, looking up at him, trying to catch her breath.

"So, we have come a long way. Shall we see what our efforts have bought us?" and Orin swung the door open.

12.

They entered what had once been a cavernous gallery with wooden panellig on the walls and floors betraying its once majestic designs. It had clearly once been a room once used for entertaining elegant heads of state on a tour of where their money was kept.

It had now been repurposed, the fine furniture pushed to the edges of the room, the once beautiful thick carpet sat roled up in the one of the corners.

Their eyes were drawn to the what now dominated the room. A single large metal contraption sat squarely in the middle of the room, surrounded by stacks of paper on half a dozen desks.

Approaching the desks, Orin picked up the papers and inspected them.

"Well, this trip has not been a waste." he said, passing one of the sheets to Emlyn.

"Promissory Notes?" Emlyn asked.

"Yes, specifically, Verrisian Promissory Notes. No doubt, Kris would like to use our own money to wage war against us. They cash these in, take our money and inflate our own economy at the same time. Perfect forgeries. The perfect crime".

"Perfect? When did you become an expert on forgery?"

"Well, they look real to me, and I assume that they wouldn't bother making them if they were anything less than perfect. While there are some people who will accept Promissory Notes as payment, with a quantity this big, they will need to turn most of these into one of our Royal Banks. If they can't fool the Banks, these will be worthless."

They walked around the room, inspecting the different notes, boxes of supplies and the copious amount of handwritten notes that were dashed around the place. Orin pulled up a chair at one of the desks and started reading."

"We're in trouble"

"Oh?"

"Well, judging from the amount of notes we have stacked here", he said indicating the promissory notes stood on the desks, " and the amounts they are refering to in these notes, there is a significant amount missing. The notes from the quartermaster indicated that about ten times as much paper has been delivered here and these notes concur. Some may have been lost to waste, ten or twenty percent maybe, but there should still be plenty stacked here."

"Well ther is no way we can really know how much has been received. They could have received paper from plenty of sources not on the manifest".

"Unlikely. Only a very specific type of paper can be used for Promissory Notes, and they are not sold on every market corner. No, I think that a large amount of notes have been produced and shipped out from here already."

Orin closed the ledger that he had been reading and stuck it into his bag along to join the stolen notes.

"Okay, this isn't really our job, but seeing as we are here and knocking out those guards has already given us away, Let us commit a little sabotage. And then lets go. This is enough evidence to indicate that Kris is almost certainly going to got to war with us"

Orin folded a few of the sheets and stuck them in his bag and then walked over to the giant metal contraption and started inspecting it. He bent over, looking at all it's different angles, before going back to one of the desks and picking up one fo the tools tha was neatly laid on it.

Going back to the machine, he took the tool and gave the tool a swift tap somewhere inside the machine before once more re-emerging.

"What was that?" Emyln asked?

"I made  a small mark on the stamp. Probably too small for anyone to notice it if they weren't looking for it, but should allow us to spot any more forgeries in the future."

"By the way, how did you know that the forgeries were being made on this floor?"

"Well", Orin started, "I heard... the machine".

"But its not in use at the moment, so what was it that you heard?"

"We need to go", Orin said and started to walk swiftly towards the door magnificent oak door before stopping dead  as it swung open violently. Two dozen soldiers, filed in spreading out along the wall in perfect formation, each with their hands on their swords, a look of steely determination in their eyes.

As the pair came through the door and stood on either side, a final man came through, a look of calm confidence and superiority on his face. Judgin from the insignia Emlyn put him down as the the Captain of the guard, the highest member of the Royal Body Guard. Emlynjudged him too be well into his sixties, he face aged and weathered, scarred and marked and his a hair a shock of grey, still plenty left, but clear sings of balding. 

But there was no mistaking his lethal physique. This man could take on half a dozen men half his age without breaking a sweat. And as he locked his eyes with Emlyn, she felt a icy hand of fear on her heart, freezing her in place.

"Well, well. Don't you too looked lost." The Captain said, his smile growing over his face. "So very far from home, and in the company of strangers. I don't suppose there is any chance of you coming with us without resorting to violence?"

Silence filled the room. Emlyn stared down The Captain and waited, heart hammerign in her chest, a thousand thoughts going through her mind. The fear was now starting to take her. It suddenly occured to Emlyn that she had never been truly afraid before. She had never truly confronted the thought of her own mortality, before this very second. That was a bit of an oversight really, surely some of her trainign should have dealt with her having to accept that she would one have to die. Now was really not a great time to have to come to terms with such things. 

"Rosie?" Orin said, breaking her out of her hypnosis. Cool as always, Orin stared directly ahead, never taking his eyes off the captain.

"Yeah?", she acknowledged breathlessly, the short word taking all of her will to speak, while her panic started to crash down on her like an enornomous wave in a sea of fear.

"Run".

13.
---

Orin turned on his heels and ran full tilt towards one of the doors on the other side of the room. 

"Draw swords!" The Captain shouted, and the Regiment moved in one smooth motion to bring their arms to bear.

Emlyn came out of her trance and charged after Orin, heading towards the rear wall. She could hear the men chargin after her, their heavy combat boots thundering on the floor. The sound of a loosed crossbow bolt rang through the room and Emlyn dived behind the printing press as the fletching skimmed past her cheek.

Her back to the press, she could see that Orin had almost reached door, and she knew there was no way that she could catch up with him before the soldiers were on her.

Tapping her Planet Well once more, she drew Merais into her once more, the power flowing from her necklace into her very soul. She crouched down, bracing her feet on the floor and she grabbed giant contraption in her hands.

With an enormous, wrenching determination Emlyn began to lift the press over herself. Slowly the press started to lift off the floor and into the air, the metal coffin hanging perilously over her.

Fighting it, inch by inch, she moved it into position, directly above her and she twisted violently tossing the press press directly at The Captain as she felt Miranis leave her, the Planet Well finally having run dry.

The framework flew through the air and careened over the elegant hall as Emlyn's feet went out from under her, the force of throwing the press tossing her in the direction. Airborn, she felt herself hurtling towards Orin, she grinned as she saw the look of disbelief of the soldiers faces.

The contraption thundered into the floor, a deafening crash bursting through the room. Emlyn could see soldiers, flung into the air as the press careened across the room, sliding at high speed towards the main doors leaving inch deep gouges into the beautfifully laid timbers.

Emlyn passed through open door, still airborn, and flew past Orin as she fianlly hit the floor, rolling over backwards, the world rotating in front of her eyes, before she found her feet, still sliding backwards from her momentum.

"Nice", Orin said, breathlessly as he continued through the immaculate state room towards the next door, Emlyn hot on his heels.

"We gotta get outside" Emlyn gasped "My Planet Well is dry."

"Third floor" Orin replied, "Down" he indicated.

Whipping her head aroud, Emlyn saw half a dozen soldiers chasing after them, swords drawn, one room behind. "Go!" she shouted.

The dashed through room after room in one long gallery, each room beautifully decorated, hanging art on the walls, exquisite chandleries lighting the rooms. Door after door they charged through, the soldiers following hot on their heels.

Emlyn's legs ached, her lngs were on fire and she felt as though her heart was about burst. They were hardly even running any more, stuck somewhere between jogging and walking fast, their breathing heavy as they tried to keep ahead of their persuers, who were in the same state.

Looking wildly for a window or a staircase they kept on limping forward. How big is this building Emlyn asked herself, there is no way they couldn't be out yet.

And just then Orin dashed through the next room and came out to a broad stone staircase leading down to the atrium at the front of the Mint. Giant stone statues stood in the atrium, men riding tigers and snakes locked in combat. And between, them stood another dozen soldiers, guarding the exit.

Emlyn could feel the whispers of Meranis through the giant plate windows, but they must have been facing south, as she could not pull on her power. She needed to get outside, but would be sliced to pieces before she got to the door. Which is almost certainly locked, she thought.

"What now?" Emlyn asked, her panic once again rising, the adrenaline starting to grip her body in spasms. The guards in front of the them drew their swords and started to advance, and Emlyn heard the guards behind them catching up.

"You catch me" Orin replied, and pointing to Emlyn's right along the walkway he whispered "The window".

Without thinking Emlyn sprinted towards the window, her body once again in agony, she willed her body to give it everything she had and burst through the glass. She raised her arms to take protect her face, and felt the glass slice at her, agony gripping her forearms as she dived into the cool night air.

Suddenly she felt Meranis' Power and drew on it once more. Ecstasy filled her, her pain disappearing into the abyss of euphoria that the Power covered her in. 

The ground rushed to her and she rolled to get her feet under her as she thundered into the ground, the air being pushed out of her lungs by her collision with the courtyard. Emlyn rolled to lessen the impact and looked up at the window she had just dived through to see Orin's siloutte diving through the window, his legs flailing in the air as two crossbow bolts flew out the window over his head.

Emlyn ran towards him and tried to predict where he would fall. As Orin careened through the night Emlyn braced herself once again for impact. as Orin pinwheeled downward Emlyn threw her arms open and caught him around the chest as he flew towards the hard stone.

The impact hit her like a chargin cavalry horse, as she was once again knoecked off her feet, careenning over the dull paving stones gripping Orin tightly as she could. As the world rotated around her she could hear the front doors of The Mint open and the soldiers poured out into the courtyard to try and surround them.

"Okay?" Emlyn asked as she disentangled herself from Orin, who gave a short nod, a graven look on his face.

"Time to fly again" she said, and bent down to give him another boost over the walls. Shaking, he placed his foot in her hands and she sent him flying into the air and onto the wall.

The soldiers charged at her, inhuman words, growls and screams spilling from their mouths. Their swords caught brilliant reflections of the moon in their polished steel. And Emlyn saw the hate in their eyes.

She bent down into a crouch and kicked off violently, evading their swords and rocketing to the top of the wall. Too much. She knew it immediately, she had used to much power, she would go sailing right over the wall. 

Time seemed to slow to a crawl, she saw the wall flying past her face, before it gave way to crenelations and then nothing but air. As she reached the peak of her jump, she looked down saw the concrete courtyard below, the soldiers all staring up at her, disbelieving. 

Under any normal circumstances she would be fine, well she would live, if she could just land on her feet in the street, but after all that she had been through tonight, she wasn't so sure anymore.

Suddenly a rope shot past her face, and she instinctively, grabbed at it and pulled.

Emlyn felt herself, getting pulled in towards the wall, when suddenly she saw Orin shooting towards her, pulled bodily off his feet by the strength of the her pull. Without thinking, she curled into a tight ball and felt Orin shoot over her head, the two of them in some kind of bizarre airborne dance, Emlyn open herself up for the landing and made a firm landing on the top of the wall, her feet looking for purchase on the dry stone.

Orin. It was a single thought, violent and urgent. His brief flight brought by pulling his rope was coming to an end he began once again to fall. Emlyn, coiled the rope in around her with a panicked urgency.

The rope became taught with about ten feet between her and orin as he went hurtling past her, in a determined silence from a man who had every reason to be screaming at the top of his lungs.

The pressure on the rope suddenly increased like the kick of a bull, the roped snapped taught, Shocking Emlyn's body, causing her to grit her teeth, as she took Orin's full weight. Planet Drinker or not, she still had the same weight, and Orin was far heavier than her. Momentum was not in her favour here.

Everything went quiet and Emlyn held her breath, straining against the rope. She looked both ways along the wall, expecting guards to come running, surely they had made too much noise.

But when no one came, Emlyn started to pull on the rope and inch by inch she lifted Orin back up, until finally his arm came over the side of the wall and he rolled over and they both collapsed onto the cold hard stone.

The charge of footsteps cam ethundering over the walls as guards closed on their position and Emlyn and Orin picked up their tired bodies and pushed themselves to the limit.

"Get the rope", Orin yelled throwing her a spare coil, and Emlyn started tying it around the crenellations, while Orin projected his throwing knives into the darkness, where Emlyn could hear the screams indicating they had made contact.

"Done", Emln yelled as she threw herself over the wall and started to bounce down the wall to the bottom. Looking up, she saw Orin swing over the wall as well and they both dropped to the  street outside.

As they dissapeared into a dark alley, Emlyn heard the front gate open and the cries of soldiers in the night. They limped through the alleys, changing direction at random until they came out at another main road.

And then Emlyn heard the bark of the hounds.

"Noo..." Emlyn moaned, as Orin grabbed her arm and pulled her onward.

14.
---

Orin threw his last knife and the dog went scittering to the ground, a yelp of pain escaping its throat. "I'm out" Orin gasped.

"Me too" Emlyn whimpered. "And I don't have the strength for another fight. I am drawing on Meranis just to walk. If I lose her again, I am going to collapse."

"Just keep going" Orin coaxed. "We are almost out. Go"

They limped onwards, through the maze of dingy streets and dark alleys. Everything hurt, Emlyn was in complete agony. Just moving one leg in front of the other took a monumental force of will. 

Emlyn could smell the ocean. They must be near the port, the salty air called for freedom, they were far away from their persuers now. With the final dog slain, surely there was no way that anyone could find them now.

"Dead end" Orin whispered, turning his back on the brick wall forbidding their way at the end of the narrow passage.  Emlyn turned and spotted the dark siloutte looming at the mouth of the road, blocking their way.

A whistle rang clear in the night sky and The Captain walked into the light, summoning his beleagured troops to assist him.

"Go Rosie. To the roof. I will meet you at the home."

"What?" Emlyn asked.

"Trust me. I can handle them, but you have to go. Now! GO!" Orin yelled. 

Emlyn turned and knelt, and kicked off. She stared down as she once again took to the air. Orin was looking up at her, and she felt as sense of doom overcoming her.

The fatigue wracked her body as she fell to the roof. Forcing herself back to her feet, she stared into the alley below and watched as Orin began to fight his way to safety.

Except, he didn't. Orin was knealt down, hands on his knees in sumbission, while The Captain approached him with two soldiers flanking him.

"A Planet Drinker? Not something a man such as I gets to see everyday." I am going to enjoy tracking her down."

Orin sat, completely passive, staring The Captain down. Emlyn could see that his breath was calm, face composed, resigned to his fate.

"Not going to run anymore? Not gonna fight?"

Emlyn froze. She had never thoughth that this would happen. Orin would allow himself to get captured, requiring that he be taken to a holding cell in some dark corner of the city dungeons.

Orin knew too much to be captured. He had probably already taken the poison which would be coursing through his veins. He would be able to distract them just enough to allow her to get away, but he would pass away during the night.

And Emlyn knew what she should do and what she must do. 
Emlyn dived. 

Putting the last of her strength into one big leap, she soared down back to the street, locking onto The Captain.

"There!", The Captain screamed, pointing into at her. She heard the bolt loose from the shadows as a soldier brought his arsenal to bear.

Emlyn felt a searing white heat engulf her and she felt herself tumble through the air and she crumpled onto the cold paving stones and in a blinding light she fell unconcious.

+++

As Emlyn jumped away Orin knelt down and prepared his last hope. He pulled a dark cardboard cyclinder from his pouch and rubbed it vicously on the ground.

He felt the pyromancer's trick ignite and threw it out into the night and tucked his head into his chest and squeezed eyes tightly.

"There!", a cry went out from the Captain and his heart started pounding, his fear rising, every second expecting a sword to his chest or neck.

Suddenly her head Emlyn cry out, her voice reverberating off the narrow alley walls, followed by a bone crunching thud as something thundered into the hard stone.

Orin's heart quavered, but he held his eyes tightly shut and counted each of his heart beats, preparing for what was about to come. 

A white hot heat washed over him, and he heard the screams of the guards and the unsteady footsteps and metal clanging on the street as the guards wheeled backwards falling over their own feet.

He rose to his feet and charged towards The Captain, who stood, dazed, with his sword held two handed in a defensive stance. Emlyn lay on the ground at his feet. A pool of blood was starting to form around her head.

Orin's hand went to his belt, but he had used his last knife and all his other weapons would bring him too close to The Captains broadsword's lethal range.

Plan B. Orin darted forward and took a long kick at The Captain's stomach, who keeled over, his sword drooping low.

Orin stepped back and straightened up to deal sharp kick to the side of The Captain's head. At least he tried, but his kick went too low and caught The Captain on the shoulder, sending them booth reeling.

Orin felt his age, a heavy weight pressing down on his body, a thick miasma of quicksand slowing down his every movement. Ten years ago he could have run a hundred leagues and dealt 100 such kicks with pinpoint precision.

But he simply wasn't the man he used to be. Smarter and wiser, definitely, but he simply couldn't do what he once had.

There was no time to think of that now. He wheeled wildly, found his footing and dived once again at The Captain,  knocking them both to the ground. 

The Captain's tried to bring his sword to bear, but Orin pushed his arm aside and, using both his hands, dashed The Captain's fist against the hard ground sending scattering his sword out of reach.

But The Captain rolled with the attack and threw blind punch into Orin's side, winding and dislodging Orin from his dominant position.

Orin rolled away and came to his feet, while his leaden lungs heaved trying to suck in the cool night air. Doubt clouded Orin's mind as he prepared for the next bout.

Suddenly The Captain's eyes cleared, and locking eyes on his sword he leapt to his feet. Orin's heart hammered in his chest and he dashed to intercept just as The Captain caught his foot on loose paving stone and stumbled to his knees, mere inches away from the sword's hilt.

Taking his second chance, Orin whipped his leg up violently and this time he made good contact and The Captain went limp as his chin met Orin's foot.

Orin looked upon the makeshift battlefield and saw three young soldiers, staring blindly out into the dark night. They clearly hadn't been able to look away and had a full blast of his flash paper.

Within a split second Orin had disregarded them and he dived to Emlyn's side, his heart in his throat, praying silently once again. Perhaps he should have been a priest he thought rhyley.

"Emlyn? Emlyn?" he whispered frantically in her ear, more loudly than was wise, but he didn't think anyone heard him. She didn't move. Orin placed his ear ove her mouth and heard her shallow breathing and his heart started again.

Orin dove his arm's under her and pulled her too his chest. She was so small, barely a weight at all. He often forgot just how fragile she was. She hid behind the mask of her incredible gift and it was difficult for anyone who knew her not to find her incredibly intimidating.

But the reality was that she was barely more than a child. In another life she would still be running around with ribbons in her hair, hoping that she would marry a prince and talking about her dream wedding with her friends.
 
And now she could be inches from death. Orin rose to his feet, supporting her head in the crook of his left arm and letting her legs dangle from his right. Her hair was drenched in blood which dripped wetly to the ground, splattering into the large pool which had already formed.
 
Orin ran. Faster than he ever had before. Emlyn's white face lolled, her eyes wide open in the pale moonlight, staring blankly at the stars above. 
 
He reached reached the bay and after stopping to ensure that Emlyn had stopped bleeding, lest he give away their path, he continued on to their Inn.
 
Emlyn now felt like a sack of bricks in his grip and his arm's ached, but he ran on and on, until, at last, the inn was in sight.
 
He hammered on the door, and an eternity passed before the door gave cracked open and he charged through.
 
"We were beset by footpads" he gasped to the startled landlady. "Please, you must get the doctor".

"There's no doctors near here, sir. And there is no way I am venturing out into the night with footpads a'prowling".

"Just get out of my way then" he said, staring at her darkly.

"Don't get me wrong, I want to help, but me getting hurt won't her out any" she replied.

"I'm sorry" Orin said, looking down for a second. "Thank you, have a good night" he said and  charged up the stairs to their room on the third floor  leaving the landlady looking up at him disbelievingly.

Orin fumbled with the lock Orin and fell into the room with Emlyn in his arms.

Using one last burst of strength he heaved her onto the desk and sank into one of the chairs, head in his hands. How had it all gone so wrong? He had done everything right, every precaution taken. Shouldn't he have even tried to go to the Mint? He was pretty sure of what was happening, but he had to confirm didn't he?

No time to think about that now, Emlyn's life still hung in the balance. Rising to his feet he put his fingers to her neck. A pulse. She had lost a lot of blood, but not too much and life still coursed through her.

His relief was intense, but he knew there were still danger. Even tiny cuts could be fatal if they became infect and this was way more than a tiny cut.

He grabbed the wash basin, placed it below her head and started to wash her wound, her long brown hanging into the basin. The water ws soon filled with blood and Orin started to treat the wound with herbs and bandage.

Finally Orin had to accept that there was nothing else that he could do and rested for a minute before carrying her to her room. He laid her on the bed and stripped her of her sweat soaked and bloodstain clothes before tucking her beneath the covers.

And finally, after a lifetime had passed, Orin fell into a Emlyn's chair and fell into a fitful slumber.

15.
---

Emlyn woke to pain and darkness. Her whole body ached, and she felt beyond nauseous. She rolled over and she felt her hair matted to the blood soaked pillow.

So, she had made it back to the inn. It occurred to her that she was lucky to have woken up at all. She could just as easily have not. The number of times she could just as easily have died... Best not to think about it.

She tried to call out for Orin. But her mouth wouldn't move. Just opening her mouth was too painful. She groaned quietly, but didn't move.

But if she had saved Orin's life, it had all been worth it. That he had been ready to give his life to save hers... Well she guessed she always knew that he would. Orin was like a father too her. She always knew, deep down, that he would lay down his life for her. And now he had.

Emlyn found herself starting to cry. And as the tears streamed down her face, her chest convulsed in sobs and the spasms wracked her with more pain.

The thought of losing Orin was more than she could bear. The weight of how close it had been fell on her and it was more than she could stand. 

Orin meant everything to her. Her anger burned at the thought that he would sacrifice himself to save her. What was she supposed to do without him? Live the rest of her life in regret. Hating herself for not being strong enough to save them both.

And she loathed herself as she selfish thought about what everyone else would think. How could a Planet Drinker let her partner die, why had she been there if not to support her superior?

She would have been released from the House, asked to spend the rest of her life as a military weapon, training as a simple brute, a killing machine. Too kind a penance for her complete incompetence.

Her thoughts darkened and she slipped back into unconciousness. She drifted in out throuhout the night, her pain being the only way she could tell when she was lucid. 

When she awoke a gain, the sun was already high int he sky and she felt Orin's hand on her forehead.

"No fever", he whispered as her eyes flickered open momentarily before she squeezed them tight against the blinding light shining through the window. Straining, she moved one of her hands from under the covers and reached out for Orin limply. He caught her hand and she entwined her fingers in his. His hand felt intensely hot.

"You have lost a lot of blood. You are very cold. But I don't think that you have an infection" he whispered. She squeezed his hand softly, and lay still.

She found herself crying again. Relief overwhelmed her, just knowing that Orin was still okay was enough to put her heart at rest. She nodded off again into a dreamless sleep, before being brought around again by Orin sitting her up against the wall.

"Time to drink", he said, placing a cup of cool water to her lips. She suddenly realized how thirsty she was and drank the water down in one long slow gulp. 

Enghhh...., new StoryLine...

As they crested the hill Jake sighed with happiness. "Ahhh, there's no place like home is there Marc?".
"Indeed", Marcus replied.
Rens lay before them, the capital city of Kris shining like a jewel before the sparkling blue Ferudian Sea. They weren't close enough to smell it yet.
"You can have some time to see your family Jake", Marcus said. "It is four hours to sundown and there won't be much time to do anything today."

Jake leant back in his saddle, flexing his stiff fingers in front of him thinking of his young wife and two children.

"But I will be will be fetching you at the crack of dawn tomorrow. If there truly is a Drinker in The Capital it is vital that we eliminate the threat as quickly as possible."

"Yes sir", the young officer replied, unconsciously willing his horse into a trot in his eagerness to make the most of today.

"Then would you like to have dinner with me tonight sir? I am sure that Samantha would like to see you again" Jake offered politely.

Marcus laughed heartily. "You know as well as I do that Sam hates me, as I am always the one stealing you away from her", Sam said, a grin on his face. 

"Thanks for the offer Jake, it is most kind. But I think it is best that you spend as much time with your family as possible, besides, I suspect that I will have plenty to do at the Keep before the morrow."

Jake's eyebrows rose, locking his eyes with Marcus's but he knew better than to ask further. Marcus would tell him whatever he needed to know when the time was right.

As they trotted up to the Second Gate the guards, noticing the insignia on their impeccably maintained uniforms, snapped to attention and saluted. The two horseman nodded in respect and pulled up.

"What news to report Lieutenant?" 

"Little enough Colonel." the guard said. "The usual crime and villainy that the summer harvest brings, but nothing remarkable."

"Indeed, well that is good news, at ease", Marcus replied, and they trotted on through the gates.

So, the guards haven't been put on alert, Jake thought to himself. Hardly surprising, that could only spark panic and rumor. Suddenly every commoner would be swearing that their neighbours were all enemy Planet Drinkers and their would be panicked mobs and lynchings in the street. And besides, what would warning the guards accomplish? They would be extra vigilant for someone who looks completely normal and they have no way to fight? Foolishness.

No, it would have to be up to them, Jake acknowledged. If they had been brought back the Crown was clearly very concerned about the threat. A pair of Scryers like themselves were a precious commodity, and they had had to abandon their mission to return home at all speed.

They had received their orders two days ago and they had ridden hard to return to Rens. So, the attackers would have had three days to make good their escape, or go fully underground. Or accomplish their mission. 

Of course, if they had succeeded, surely the city would be alive with gossip and rumors. But no, it was just another beautiful summers days, they had made it in time.

"Alright, I am headed up to the keep, you are headed home", Marcus said pulling up his horse at one of the wide intersections.

Jake put out his hand and Marcus shook his hand. 

"Dawn tomorrow?" Jake asked. "See you then"

---

Jake plodded down the familiar streets leading to his home. Some of shop keepers gave him a cheery wave as he rode, and wished him well on his return. He thanked them, but didn't slow his horse until he was finally within site of his home.

He lived in a good part of Rens. Not the residence of the exceptionally rich, but home to shopkeepers and scribes and other welll off members of society. If his career went well and he received the promotion he deserved, he would be able to move his family to within the Royal Square, where his two girls would be able to attend the best schools and find good husbands.

But for now, he was content. He tied his horse to the post by the water trough and he took the final few steps towards his home.

Removing his hat, he stepped through the wide open door, eyes blinking, adjusting from the sun outside to the relative gloom inside. His wife Jessica looked up with a quizzical expression from where she was sat reading at the kitchen table, before launching out of her chair in a maniacal dash towards him.

"My love!" she screamed, jumping into his arms and wrapping her legs around his waist. Bracing himself he caught her, engulfing her with his arms, his hat still in hand while she found his lips with hers. He lvoed how passionate Jessica was, which only became more intense after his long excursions.

Finally after an eternity and entirely out of breath, he let her drop to the ground as his two girls peeked their heads around the corner. Kim was four years and Anna had just turned six. Her present was in his bag. 

"Daddy", they chorused and he dropped to his knee and picked them both up in his arms.

"Oh wow, you two have got really big!", he exclaimed, their laughter bubbling up and putting a huge grin on his face.

"I was told you would be getting back until tomorrow! I wanted to prepare something special!", Jessica exclaimed in mock disappointment, wringing her hand

"We rode hard, I wanted to get back to you as soon as possible." he said, pecking her on the cheek. "Seeing my girls is the only special thing that I need."

Jake placed his daughters down again and dropped into a chair at the kitchen table, opening his bag.

"Happy Birthday Anna!" he said, his eldest daughter looking up to him, an excited expression on her face. "I am sorry I wasn't here, but I got you a present!", he said, pulling a small package wrapped in brown paper from his bag and handing it to her.

"And what do we say?", Jessica admonished as Anna's fingers darted to rip open the gift. 

"Thank you Daddy!", she said, giving him a big smile before her eyes quickly darted back to the box.

Within seconds the paper had been torn assunder and both girls were crouched over the prize. And with a squeal of delight Anna held a beautiful golden brooch in her hands.

"Thak you daddy", she repeated, giving him yet another big hug, gazing at the brooch admiringly in her outstretched hand.

"Here, let me put it on for you", Jessica said, affixing the pin to Anna's dress.

"I have something else for the two of you", he said, once again tipping into his bag and this time withdrawing to matching, exquisitely worked porcelein dolls, in long flowing white dresses and carefully painted faces.

"These are all the way from the city of Nermisis, where they make the best dolls, for only the most beautiful girls to play with he said, handing one doll to each of them. "I had these specially made for each of you", he said, pointing to where each of their names were perfectly embroidered in long flowing script into the back of the dresses.

"Can you read what this says?", he asked his elder daughter.

"Anna!", she said, looking up brightly.

"And can you read what this says?" he asked Kim, but she only shook head. "Do you want to take a guess?" he asked cheerfully, but she only shook her head again, looking down. 

"It says Kimberly, so you will always know it's yours", he said leaning down and giving her a kiss on her head. "Now why don't the two of you go and play with your new dolls while I help your mother prepare dinner", he said, giving them one final hug, before they dashed into the back of the house with gleeful voices.

As their voices died away, he pulled Jessy into another passionate kiss, them both making up for lost time. Things seemed to change so quickign when he was aware. He could hardly believe how much bigger his two girls had gotten in the four months that he had been away, he feared that next time he returned after a long trip they might be married with kids of their own if they kept up this pace.

And the house looked different. Nothing was where is had been when he had left. The kitchen table had been rotated and heavy shutters and curtains which had remained drawn during winter had now be thrown open to invite the light summer breeze to give relief from the pounding heat. There were new furnishings, clearly keeping up with the latest fashions with the other mothers of the neighbourhood.

"I am so happy you are back", she said, once again breaking off their elongated embrace.

"Me too", Jake replied, as they both found their seats.

"So" she said, with a neutral expression on her face, "how long do I have you for this time."

"Ahh". He would have to be careful about how he directed this one. "Well, I am afraid that I am not technically on leave  yet. I am still going to have to be reporting to the barracks everyday."

"You finally got a City deployment?" she said, her face brightening visibly.

"In a sense, but I am afraid it is not permanent and I am not sure how long it is going to be. But for the time being I will be in Rens, and after this I will have my leave before my next deployment."

"Well, that's something. Perhaps if you are lucky, they will decide to keep you on, training the young cadets in the Keep perhaps.", Jessica said hopefully.

"Perhaps", he replied, perhaps a little too sharply. "Lets not talk about that now Jessy, there will be plenty of time later.", he said more sofltly this time. Jessica just nodded. "Dinner?" he asked rising from his chair.

And for a while, they forgot their problems and worries and talked Jessy talked about how well the girls were doing in their lessons and what a lovely dancer Anna was and Jake talked about all the beautiful places that he had seen and would one day take all of them. And all the love and hope and beauty that Jake had hidden deep down in his soul while he had been away started to come back to the surface. And by the time they sat down for their evening meal Jake was once again part of a family.

Leaving Jake at the turn, Marcus headed up to the keep. There were many things he needed to know. Things that were too dangerous to be entrusted to the bird wing, whther encrypted or not. Scant little had been stated, but if they had been ordered to return to Rens at all speed then it could mean only one thing. And if that was the case then they were in severe peril. 

Of course The Capital was protected at all times against all possible threats. While details were hidden from even him, there were at least a dozen active Scryers guarding The King at all times. And when he was seated in Rens they guarded the entire city, patrolling the ports and gates, looking out for anything suspicous. 

For just as a Planet Drinkers could pull on power of the Planets when they were in correct conjunction, Scryers could detect any attempt to do so. Drinkers got their power by abosrbing the power from the planets they were attuned with. This power was being radiated through the cosmos at all times, but for most people, it would just travel straight through them, as if they were panes of glass.

But when a Planet Drinker was exposed to their power, they would absorb it, as though a cloud passed over sun, casting a shadow on the ground. And Scryers could feel these "shadows". It was like passing a sudden cool spot where the sun as been obscured. It took a lot of focus and practice to be able to pick up the small changes, but it soon became second nature.

A Drinker pulling on their power on the oher hand was like turning night to day. They would cast long shadows of power, that could be felt by any Skryer in the vicinity. An experienced Skryer would even claim that they could see pattern as sure as if it were a shadow cast by the sun.

But their were ways other than Skryers to detect the presence of spies. And so Marcus decided that he would make a quick detour before reporting to the Keep.Riding onto a side street where he wouldn't be recognized he found a young courier, slipped him a letter, a coin and whispered a few words and  headed for the Keep as young boy sprinted off.

It was a long ride from the Second Gate to the Royal Keep. As the security got heavier and the patrols more frequent Marcus received more salutes and welcomes. Perhaps it would have been better to enter The City under cover of night, he thought to himself. Any Drinker with access to the rumour mill would know that two Scryers had just returned to Rens now. That could be disadvantageous to them.

Still, there was nothing he could do about it now, and odd things happened every day, the he and Jake returning early was just another thing in hundreds.

Finally approaching the gates he dismounted and handed his reigns to one of the stable boys who was nearby, knowing that he would ensure that his stallion was correctly taken care of.

"Colonel Marcus Hennis, here to see the Captain of the Guard", he declared to the guards, marching forward. The soldiers stepped back, allowing him into the first courtyard, where some of the younger officers were at morning drills. 

One of the many opportunities that wealth brought was being able to buy your sons a commision at the Royal Keep where they would be one step away from power and glory. While any soldier could rise through the ranks, few ever did. There were too many advantages to giving the scarce promotions to soldiers from rich families. Debts and promises owed to you for a powerful lords son could be invaluable in time.

Marcus' feet carried him down the familiar corridors, towards office of The Captain of the Guard. At each checkpoint he was stopped, and finally outside the door was asked to give up his sword before he was finally admitted. He wouldn't need weapons to kill any of them, but you never knew with The Captain, at over sixty he was still as strong as an ox.

The doors opened at he stepped through to see The Captain sat at his desk, fixing the young Colonel with a cool gaze. Marcus walked a few steps into the room before clipping his heels together in a salute, staring straight ahead. 

"Sit", The Captain directed, waving his hand to the chair in front of his desk. Marcus relaxed his posture and sat down as the doors behind him closed with small click. Once he had sat down The Captain continued.

"There are Drinkers in City. And they are almost certainly trying to assassinate the King". Marcus' face was locked in a neutral expression, but a thousand thoughts flashed through his mind at once. Who, what, why? The Captain rummaged through his draw and pulled out a red leather folder embossed with Royal Seal of Kris.

"This is everything we know so far", The Captain said sliding folder to Marcus who promptly flipped it open.

"Meranis... hmmm..." the First Scryer mused to himself. He flipped through the pages, his frown groing as he continued. Finally, he closed the file. "Well, this does make for interesting reading."

"Yes. Well, congratualations, this is now your problem. We need you to find them and bring them in alive, assuming that they are still in Rens". The Captain started filling out some papers on his desks. His pen dashed across the page in flowing script, filling out the paperwork that kept the world turning.

"You will have access to whatever resources you think that you need", The Captain said, handing one of the papers to the Colonel and placing it's duplicate in his own folder. "But this must remain absolutely secret. I want just you and your apprentice to bring them in. No troops. And remember, under no circumstances must these terrorists be killed during capture. It is imperative that we capture them alive. The girl especially. I expect your plan on my desk by ninth bell tomorrow."

The Captain gave a dismissive gesture and Marcus stood up, saluted again and left by the same door.

---

He stood on the corner of a dark street watching the dispicable world slowly choke itself to death. He watched as footpads prowled the corners, the whores plied their trade to the foul sailors and the lone rich men rode through, oblivious, in their carriages. 

Marcus awaited his contact. It was time to find out what was really going on this city. Something didn't add up. If someone truly wanted the King dead he would be dead already. No matter what kind of security you had, you could not defeat a determined Planet Drinker assasin. But why just send a single drinker? And a young inexperienced girl at that. Not that Colonel Hennis would ever underestimate a Drinker for being a girl; once you had the power of a Planet inside you, you were more animal than man.

But still, if you were attempting to kill The King, you would send a team. Four, five Planet Drinkers. A huge investment, few countries could boast that many Planet Drinkers. But to send just one Drinker and an old man made no sense. Verris was powerful, if they were truly behind this they would have got the job done. Something was wrong, and hopefully his contact would know why.

In shadows across the street a carriage pulled up. With the curtains drawn the passenger was hidden, along with his dark passenger deep inside of him. There were unspeakable delights to be had by those with power. Sick pleasures and ravenous appetites, satiated by dining upon the desperate. Marcus could hear mumbles of the footman offering good money for a few hours work, hey you might even enjoy it. She would never be seen again. A long finger pointed out at a young beggar girl, barely an adolescent, cowering behind her friends. She shook her head, backing into the wall behind her but the clink of coin could clearly be heard, and her companions jostled her pushing her forward, towards her certain doom. She started to shake, but there would be no point crying now, no one would listen. 

Marcus felt his anger build in him. Not just at the injustice that she was being subjected to, but at his complete powerlessness to do anything. Even if he could save this one, the rich were too powerful. All it would take is the right word in the right ear and before long he would be congratulated on a job well done and given a commision in a quiet part of the world, far from politics or war, a place where he could be swept under the rug and forgotten. 

She took her last free steps and entered the hearse. The door slammed behind her and with a crack of reins the carriage departed and the beggar children squeeled with delight over their blood money.

"So, you're still alive? Seems like I owe somebody some money". 

"So it would seem, Loron", Marcus replied, his face turning in a smile to the man who had just leant on the wall next to him. "Although, at this point it might be easier for you to keep a list of the people you don't owe money to", he continued.

"Hey, no using real names at clandestine meetings, Tobias.", Loron replied jestingly, as he pulled a pipe from his coat pocket and started packing it with tobacco. 

"No one knows that name anymore", Mark responded, his tone short. "Tobias Kimin died a long time ago, in unmarked grave in a land far away", 

"Of course, my mistake", Loron acknwoledged, pulling a steel rod from his tobacco pouch and striking it sharply against the top of his pipe. A few seconds later the dark glow of burning tobacco illuminated his face and he pulled on the pipe deeply, illuminating the pair of them.

"So", Loron continued, "what emergency brings you to call on a simpleton like me to meet you so urgently?"

"Well, I was hoping that you could tell me. What on earth is going on in this city?"

"Lots of things, I think you may need to be more specific. There is of course the harvest festival which there have been plenty of preparations for. Or perhaps, you are talking about the Mayor's daughters wedding, which was the talk of the town last month. Or are you talking about the ten Planet Drinkers who are roaming around the city, trying to assassinate the king".

It appeared as though rumours were flying though the ranks. One Drinker had transformed into an army through retellings. According some the inside of the Royal Mint had been leveled by an eight foot giant, in it's destructive rage. In other tales the Planet Drinker took the form a beautiful seductress who would enslave you with just a stare. Suffice it to say, any story that was even remotely truthful was more likely coincidence than reasoned thought.

"And what do you think?", Marcus inquired.

"Well, I think it is likely that a couple of Planet Drinkers were in the Royal Mint the other night, but by now I am guessing they are long gone".

"And their motive?"

"Who can know. I am guessing that you know more than me."

"The Captain thinks they're assassins."

"Yes, well he would. It's his job to be paranoid", Loron conceded.

Marcus stood deep in thought while Loron continued to suck on his pipe, illuminating the two of them. It appeared as though there wasn't going to be any simple solutions to this one. He was going to have to use old fashioned detective work here. He continued to quiz Lorin for any truths might be gleaned from a thousand disparate rumors, but it didn't seem promising. 

Handing a bag of gold to Lorin, Marcus started to take his leave. 

"I will send you a message if I find anything else out", Loron said putting out a hand. "Good doing business with you as always."

"Indeed, please do. Take care of yourself Loron", and with that they seperated ways. It was time for Marcus to do what he did best. Search and Destroy.

Emlyn could feel Meranis start to peek over the horizon, her pain easing slightly as its warmth washed over her. Her body still ached, but with Meranis up, she would be able to shuffle around. She slipped out of bed, threw on a dress, bending over as she couldn't quite pull her arms above head height. She suddenly felt cold, and she pulled her blanket off her bed, tucked it around her and suffled through the door.

As she entered the dining room Orin looked up from his papers and fixed her with a calm gaze.

"Good to see you are  back to galivanting around". Emlyn gave a small smile, and sat down on the chair opposite him and pulled her blanket around herself.

"Well, I am glad that you are up, I was going to come an get you in a few minutes anyway", he said, removing his glasses and rubbing his eyes with his open palms.

"We are escaping tonight", he continued, "this afternoon in fact, as soon as Meranis has set".

Emlyn knew what that meant, and she wondered whether she had the will to continue. To make her flight without Meranis to stengthen her may literally be more than she could handle.

"So, we are hunted then?", Emlyn inquired.

"It would seem so. It makes sense for them to do so, and in the three days you have been laid up, they will have been scouring the city for you."

Orin replaced his glasses and shuffled through his papers looking for the relevant ones.

"I have these. And these", he said pushing the documents to her. "But more than that, one of my contacts tells me directly that they have recalled their elite Scryer team to the city".

"Attempted assasination?", Emlyn whispered in an exasperated voice looking up from the stolen parchment. "Is there something you aren't telling me?"

"This is the first I have heard of it I assure you. It's not the Houses position to assasinate kings. And I would have told you if that was our goal."

"No you wouldn't", Emlyn quipped back.

"No. I wouldn't", Orin acknowledged. "But there is no assasination plot." 

"No, it wouldn't make any sense. But it most certainly is an odd conclusion to draw" Emlyn said thoughtfully.

"Not really. For all we know the King may just have happened to be at The Mint that night, for reasons unknown to us.", Orin hypothesised. "It would most certainly explain how the guards arrived there so quickly. Also, you might not be aware but the captain of the Royal Guard was there. Very peculiar."

That made sense to Emlyn, but Orin still wasn't convinced. They discussed the different possibilities, but the fact was that it was all irrelevant now. There was nothing for them to do at this point but return to Verris and report to the House.

"Well, on that point, I have a point. But I suspect that you are not going to like it.

"Alright, this looks like the place", Jake said as Marcus rode up to the Jake, taking in the strong sea breeze of the peer. "An old man returned in the middle of the night with a young girl, fifteen or sixteen the innkeeper reckons, covered in blood. Says they were attacked by footpads".

Jake, motioned over to the inn in question, a moderate place on the waterfront. Nice enough for a artisan engraver and ward, sa their quarry claimed to be, but he most certainly wouldn't take Jessica there. It was just the kind of place that you would stay if you didn't want to be noticed. Not too many guards trying to keep order among ruffians and not too many night patrols by the city guard, trying to make the rich feel safe and sound.

"And it was definitely the night of the attack?", Marcus inquired.

"Yes. I am pretty sure these are the ones. The innkeeper says that the man, Derin Tomlin is the name he uses by the way, settled his account this morning. He must be fleeing today. But he was still at the inn when she left a two bells ago."

Marcus thought deeply. 

"No. This guy isn't stupid. He knows that if we are watching him, settling his account would indicate his intentions." Marcus furrowed his brow, his horse twitching, responding to the anxiety of its master. Marcus spoke slowly. "He must be trying to force our hand. Meranis is approaching it's zenith. He wants us to attack when his Drinker is at her full power."

Yes, that did seem logical Jake thought. This is what it must be like to battle true opponents. Trying to always think one step ahead of each other. But if their opponents were truly brilliant then surely they would be aware that Marcus would know what they were trying to do? So they must have made their move knowing that it would make Marcus wary of attacking. But to what end?

"We wait", Marcus announced. "Whatever their plan is, the fact is that they aren't going anywhere with Meranis up. They are going to wait for Meranis to fall, and then try and slip away in the crowds, to some pre-arranged exit strategy". 

Jake nodded solemly, trying to think of what they would need to do.

"And if they flee now?"

"They won't. They are hoping that we will attack while we can identify her, thinking that they can slip by annonymously. If they do try to slip out with Meranis in conjunction, the target will be obvious and I will follow while you get backup. But they won't. Trust me."

---

"It's time to go", Emlyn said rising to her feet. Her legs shook slighly as her anxiety swelled in her chest. If they were truly hunted as Orin suspected then they were taking a huge gamble. 

But as Meranis started sinking below the horizon Emlyn and Orin prepared themselves for their escape. Orin had already destroyed all their non-essential equipment. They had slowly filled the fire with their ciphers and codes. All their bulky tools had been broken down and distributed in the back alleys of the surrounding neighbourhood and their extra clothes had been distributed to the vagrants. By the time any tracking dogs get their nose on the garments, they would be filled with the odours of the slum.

All they had left was a small bag on each of their backs for their essential gear. Their belts held their weapons and anything that they couldn't do without, in the event that they had to drop their bags in a chase. Finally they had their emergency provisions strapped under their clothes, in the event that the worst would happen.

As Meranis finally winked out, Emlyn nodded to Orin. 

"You ready?" He inquired, a grave look on his face. Emlyn swallowed, and tried to speak, but her voice caught in her throat. She felt sick. If she opened her mouth she was afraid that she might spill her lunch. In the end she just nodded.

"Lets go."

---

"Here they come" Jake said as the pair exited the front of inn. "Just as Meranis sets, just as you said. Marcus just nodded.

They had eschewed their uniforms, instead taking the clothes of the surrounding crowds. This would take tact, alacrity and skill. And if even the smallest thing gave away their intentions, their quarry would flee. In any normal circumstances they would have been able to call on a battalion of guards to apprehend these terrorists. But according tot Marcus, The Captain had been very clear that this was to be absolutely secret. And the city watch wasn't known for it's discression.

"Lets go" Marcus said, and slipped into the crowds, hiding in plain site as he tracked his victim. Jake followed him and swept a wide arc around the boardwalk, trying to keep his eye on the assasins, Marcus and his feet while attempting not too look suspiscous. His heart beat started to rise as he watched Marcus getting closer and closer. Marcus' eyes spun wildly in his head, seeking out every avenue of attack and every possible danger. 

Jake turned in towards the assasins, trying to blend in with the crowd as much as possible. Inch by inch he got closer and closer, and finally he was behind them, walking along oblivious to world, watching out of the corner of his eye as Marcus converged on him from far right. Slipping effortlessly through the masses Marcus approached at a startling pace.

And suddenly he was on them. Jakes heart raced as Marcus dived forward and threw his fist in a wide arc into her stomach. In a blur, time passed slowly and Jake saw the girl slouch over, crying out in pain as Marcus' full power came into contact with her. Suddenly guardian swept his hand to his belt and suddenly produced a knife. 

In one smooth underarm motion he broguht the knife to bear on Marcus, but Jake's training had already kicked in and he found himself barreling forward, and before he was aware he had wrapped his arms around the would be assasin and tackled him into the dirt, the knife going sprawling into the dirt.

As the world spun, Jake glimpsed Marcus take on the Planet Drinker. It wasn't much of a fight. At roughly treble her weight there was no contest. She sprawled on the ground crying out for help. Marcus aimed a large sweeping kick at her torso and she simply whimpered, unable to fight back.

But Jake's opponent was not ready to go out so quickly. He bucked and kicked as Jake held onto him with all his strength. They rolled over and over and the man gesticulated wildly, hitting Jake's head into the ground repeatedly as Jake cursed and shouted. 

Finally, after what felt like an age Jake finally found himself on top and threw the assasin into an head lock. At first he struggled wildly, but eventually he accepted the inevitable and he finally fell limp.

A large crowd had formed around them and Jake could hear the city guard approaching, last to an incident as usual. He glanced at Marcus just in time to see him pull his finger out of the back of Drinkers throat as she threw up violently on the paving stones. With that Marcus threw a black sack over her head and began to bind her hands viscously behind her back and Jake followed suit with his prisoner.

Once the bonds were secure Marcus raised his prisoner to her feet. He kicked through the girls lunch with his boot, but there was no Planet Well. But yo could never be too carefull.

"WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?"

A roar burst from the leader of the patrol, who's eyes fumed and sword swayed in hand eagerly hoping to spill someone's blood.

"Just capturing two counterfeiters sir. On the King's Justice.", Marcus said, producing his official writ, inked in beautiful cursive script and signed by The Captain of the Guard himself.

The lietentant's eyes dashed across the page, his face darkening as he slowly realized the unbridled power that the writ provided them. Finally he handed back the parchment sharply and saluted.

"Excellent. Now may we borrow two of your horses please" Marcus said, smiling widely. The lietenant's face flashed to pure anger, but he pointed and led on and Marcus and Jake followed him, pulling their unwilling prisoners with them.

As they Jake threw his prisoner over his horse, he heard the girls sobs beside him. A pang of sorrow went out from him for a second. Not for the pain that she had suffered, but for what she was about to suffer. 


20.
---

The girl had finally stopped struggling by the time that they had carried her into the keep. She had fought and scratched and screamed, before Marcus finally gagged her with his own scarf and cursed her with every threat under the sun.

They had taken their prisoners to the Scryers Hold, the one place where they could safely place a Planet Drinker. Their holding cells were buried deep, and warded against every possible mean by which a Drinker might gain power.

They dumped her to the ground in a dank dark cell, illuminated only by flaming torches, set in cast iron brackets. Jake dragged her into the corner, and clamped manacles around each of her arms and legs. He checked and double checked the restraints before returning to the door.

"Hey you", he shouted to one of the guards, who ran in and stood to attention.

"You are going to sit stand by this door and watch this prisoner directly. Do not approach the prisoner. Do no take your eyes off the prisoner. If you rest your eyes or fall or asleep you might not wake up again."

The soldier stared at the hooded creature bound in the corner, and gulped nervously.

"I am going to position a soldier on the outside of the door. Check in with him regularly. If you see anything odd going on, report it."

And with that Jake left the cell, locking the door behind him. 

"She's secure", he informed Marcus, who was leaning nonchalantly, in the corridor. 

"It's hard to believe that she is the biggest threat to the realm isn't it?", Marcus said, as he made his way out of the holding cells.

"Yeah, I have never fought a Drinker so young. Seems really odd that any kingdom would deploy her without backup."

"Well, we will have all the answers we need soon enough. I have sent a runner to the Keep, to confirm the succesful pickup." 

Marcus paused, as he was let throguh the exit doors of the holding cells, returning to the well lit courtyard of the Scryers Hold. 

"We just need to go through their bags, fill out the paper-work, and we might even be able to get home become sundown", Marcus continued. 

---

Orin couldn't tell how much time had past. It felt like days, but he doubted that more than six bells had been struck since he had been captured. 

Lying in the dark, time seemed to draw out like a blade. Every thought imaginable ran through his head. Every creak, and echo in the deep recesses of the his cell sounded like Emlyn's screams.

Orin rolled over, and took a deep breath, trying to save his energy. While there was breath, there was hope, but no matter which way he looked at it, he couldn't remember being in such a tight spot. He had taken a gamble and he had lost. But that is why you always had more plans...

Of course they had been watched. They should have left straight away, but Orin didn't want to risk Emlyn's health after a fight like that. But they had waited too long, and they had been tracked down. Now their salvation lay in Emlyn's hands.

---

Marcus and Jake looked up from the confiscated bags, their sheets expertly filled out listing the contents in all their startling !!boringnes!!. There was a commotion outside, and they both placed their pens back in their holders, and collected their papers together.

It was clear that they had picked up some, spies. Single-use cipher sheets and detailed maps were stored away carefully in leather binders. Those would be of some use to the code breakers up at the Keep, but nothing that would give leverage to The Scryers.

But it was, the things that were missing that were truly interesting. There was no Planet Well, which seemed odd as the dosier they had received clearly stated theat they had access to one. It wasn't uncommon for a Drinker to swallow their Well if they expected to be captured, but Marcus had been sure to expel an potential threat during the arrest. No Plane Well had been in her stomach or on her person.

There also didn't seem to be any escape paraphinalia. No tickets, or contracts, or writs-of-passage. A little odd, but they may have hidden them somewhere outside of the city, just in case. The really prepared always had a backup plan.

None of this mattered to Marcus. They had them safely captured now, and once the Confessors arrived they would find out anything they wanted to know. It would just be a matter of time.

Marcus led them into the courtyard, where a loud argument was going on between their guards and a group of about eight horse men at the gate. 

"What's going on here?" Marcus exclaimed, approaching the would be trespassers.

"They say they are here to pick up the prisoner you arrested today", the gatekeeper explained. "I told them they cannot enter without authorisation."

"We have the highest authorisation", one of the Horsemen declared, his horse twitching with the nervousness of the scene."

"Of course", Marcus said reassuringly, trying to calm everyone down. "We just have to be careful. It is nearly sundown and we don't like strangers poking around the Scryers Hold after nightfall."

"We ain't strangers.", the horseman replied, holding a scroll in his outstretched hand.

Marcus took the scroll, broke the red seal, noting thie Royal Seal of Kris that adorned it. Placing his spectacles to his eyes darted across the page.

"Of course not. Please, enter. My men will take care of your horses", and Marcus gestured placatingly towards the holding cells. "Your prisoner is right this way. Let me just fill out the paperwork."

"Be quick about it. As you say, it is nearly nightfall. We want to be on our way as soon as possible."

"Follow me", Marcus invited, and stepped quickly in the directions of the cells. 

"I assume that you know the danger that you guys are dealing with?", Marcus enquired?

"We know", one of the figures confirmed.

"Meranis will be up in one hour", Jake replied. "If you do not have this prisoner in your deepest darkest dungeon by then, there is no power in the world that will be able to save you".

"We got it", another of the strangers replied.

The door of the holding cells swung open as Marcus approached, the doorman nodding his head in respect. The low sun, cast long shadows on the floor as they marched down the brick corridor. 

"Please take a seat", Marcus offered as they reache the room where they had just been filling out their ledgers. "Let us just fill out the paperwork. Jake will accompany your men to get the prisoner", and Jake nodded and headed down into the darkness, taking their guests with them. 

The leader, sat down and cracked his knuckles ominously, while Marcus reached for his pen.

"Not, every day that we see a member of The Unbreakable around town. Too see eight of them in one night, I should consider myself lucky", Marcus said lightly, as he filled out the transfer forms.

"I have to say, I don't see why this Drinker is any of your concern, especially, when I got explicit orders from the Captain of the Guard himself to bring her in myself". The Unbreakable's face remained emotionless, almost bored.

"But if you are on the Kings personal business, then I suppose it is none of my concern". Still nothing.

"Please sign here", Marcus said finally, passing the parchment over the table to the man's outstreched hand. The man took the parchment and quickly and elegantly signed his name. "Seven Hundred and Sixty Eight", spelled out in flowing in cursive script.

"Wonderful", Marcus said, putting the form into his leather folder. 

They sat in silence for a moment, until the other Unbreakables finally returned, the prisoner held between them, more walkign than limping, with Jake bringing up the rear. 

"Take her to the keep immediately", Seven Sixty Eight ordered, and four of his men exited, taking their prisoner with them. Four of the Unbreakable remained.

"Now, I believe that you ahve another prisoner, who was in collusion with the Planet Drinker."

"That's correct, a certain Master Tomlin, who we believe was her handler. From the documents that we gathered, he seems to be a Verrisian spy".

"Documents?", the lead Unbreakable asked?

"All listed here", Marcus replied, handing the manifest over. The Unbreakable's eyes darted over the page, a quizzical look on his face

"Nothing, definitive on this list", he finally stated. "I want to tie up the loose ends tonight. I want to interrogate him".

"He is my prisoner. Unless you have another order...", Marcus replied. The leader just stared at him, his cool eyes burrowing into Marcus' skin. "But of course, I will provide every convenience to someone on the King's business. This way please"

21.
---

Orin felt the two men enter the cell. He could feel the heat of their flamign torches on his skin, but the bag on his head kept him in pitch darkness. He sized them up as they lifted him up by the arms. These guys meant business. Strength radiated from them, and they clearly each had about a foot on him. Without his tools he would be hard-pressed to take on one of them. He would have to wait for his moment.

They half dragged him through the unknown darkness, before roughly pushing him into a chair. He felt restraints being thrown around his arms and then his legs roughly, before finally  his hood was ripped off. His recoiled where he sat in response to the sudden blinding light. He blinked, staring dumbly as figures began to take form.

"Hello, Master Tomlin". The voice was calm and collected, without a hint of menace, making it truly terrifying. The man speakin he hadn't seen before, but he was sat next to the the man who had assaulted them in market. The man who had pinned him to the ground was leaning against the wall.

"What's going on? Who are you people?", Orin replied adopting his Master Tomlin persona, with terror in his voice. There was no way that would fool them, but if you were about to be tortured, it was much easier to continue your protestations of mistaken identity. If he held out long enough he might even begin to believe it.

"I think you will find that this will be a lot easier if you allow us to ask the questions", the man replied.

"I don't know what you think I have done, but I swear I didn't do it! I am a good man, not some kind of cutthro..", Orin said, slightly hysterical know, before his head was suddenly thrust forward into the table by an unseen hand behind him.

"As I was saying, this will be easier if you just answer my questions. Do you understand?" the man continued. Orin collected himself, before nodding shortly, his head aching and still spinning slightly.

"Excellent. What is your name?"

"Tomlin. Derin Tomlin."

"Come now, we both know that's not true. Now, we don't have an inquisitor here, or any specialised instruments, but I am sure that I can find a way to make you more honest". 

His voice remained cool and collected. He could have been talking about how beautiful the weather was, rather than threatening Orin with unimaginable compliance techniques. Orin had to admit, he was in a pretty tight spot. His eyes roamed the cell, looking for something, anything that might give him an idea of what to do.

"Where is my niece?", Orin asked pleadingly. "Is she okay?"

"Oh, I am afraid that your niece isn't with us anymore. But I hope for her sake she is a lot better at answering questions than her uncle. Otherwise things are going to go very badly for her".

Orin's face fell, a look of complete hopelesness finally taking over.

"So, shall we try again. What is your name?"

Orin just started crying, and once again he felt his head violently wrenched into the table in front of him.

"What is your name?"

Bam.

"What is your name?"

Bam.

"What is your name?"

Bam.

The Captain of the Guard watched as the four men rode into the courtyard of the Royal Keep. He leant in the shadows, watching from afar as the men pulled up their horses and transfered their package down, to the men awaiting them who dragged the prisoners away.

The men had a quick discussion, their low whispers echoing through the night sky. It was time to tie up the loose ends. There was a certain poetry to it really. In one blow, he would take out Seargent Marcus, who had so often opposed him, he would replace their weak king and precipitate the requirements for war against Verris all for the good of the realm.

As the horsemen turned around and charged back out the gates to belay his orders, The Captain fo the Guard turned to his own chambers. Now he needed only to wait for his palns to come to fruition.

---

Orin spat blood on the table. The beating had stopped, so he guessed that he should look on the bright side.

On reflection, he doubted that these guys really wanted answers at all. They just seemed to enjoy watching him suffer, which he guessed was fair enough. If you enjoyed inflicting pain on others then at least get paid for doing what you loved. But they clearly, didn't really expect him to give up any real answers.

The knock at the door which had interrupted their conversation was followed by anyother dark robed man entering the room. His inquisitor mumbled some threat about "better habing better answers when he returned", and then followed his acquaintance out of the cell.

"You know, we are eventually going to have all the information that we need. You are only hurting yourself."

The man that had arrested them was talking now. He had sat impassionately throughout his interrogation, a look of disgust on his face.

"I keep telling you, you have the wrong man.", Orin replied.

"Of course." he acknowledged. "I have to admit, I don't like my companions methods. I find them very quite primative really. As you can imagine, I mostly deal with Planet Drinkers. Given enough time, they would sell out their own mothers just be allowed to bask in a small sliver of Planet Light."

"I am sure you care a great deal for your niece.", he continued. "What was her name again? Rosie?". Orin simply sighed. "Well, I am sure you don't want her to suffer what you have suffered. Why not just come clean about everything? Give us no reason to hurt her?"

"She hasn't done anything." Orin moaned. "Whatever sins I may have committed, she is blameless."

"The power is in your hands." his captor replied.

The two men suddenly re-entered. 

"Okay, we are done here." the interrogator said. "Thank you for your time."

The interrogator crossed to the side, and stuck out his hand and captor shook his hand. As the knife sunk into his captor's back, the interrogator declared. "You have been sentenced to summary execution for conspiring in the assassintation of the king!"

---

Sitting down at the table, the Captain loomed and slowly cracked his knuckles trying to be as imposing as he could. "So, we are about to have a little chat", The Captain said, nodding to one of the guards. The grabbed and the prisoners head yanked his head off the table roughly.

A sixteen year old girl, hair matted to her face with sweat, stared into The Captains head.

The Captain's heart skipped a beat. He stared in shock at her face, tracing every line of her features. True, it had been dark, and fast and violent that night. But there was no getting away from it. This was not the girl that he had fought.

She looked similar, certainly. She was the same age, she had the same hair. But this was a different girl.

His mind reeled. A thousand different thoughts fought for supremacy in his mind. Who was this girl? Was she connected to the spies? Where was the Planet Drinker?  Should he continue the interrogation? Could anyone else tell he was surprised? What should he do now?

---

Jake strained as he was tackled into the wall by three cloaked Unbreakables. Marcus' scream echoed off the walls of the cell, as the knife was twisted in his back.

"For your involvement in the assasination of the king, you face execution", Seven Hundred and Sixty Eight stated.

Jake tried to kick off the wall, but only succeeded in crashing into the floor painfully.

"So, this is how it ends?", Marcus asked, his voice catching in his throat as he forced the words out slowly.

"I am afraid so.", the executioner replied. "Don't worry, it will all be over soon."

But Marcus wasn't looking at him anymore. His eyes were locked on the door to their cell. And Jake felt it, the cold chill radiating from the other side of the door that could only mean one thing. 

The door splintered open with thundering crash

Emlyn smashed through the door, leaving the trail of unconcious guards behind her. She was too deep to feel Meranis anymore, but her Planet Well was still full. 

She entered to the sight of shocked faces, looking at her in complete bewilderemnt. She seemed to have interrupted some kind of scuffle betweem the jailers. In the corner four were grappling on the ground, the ones at the table seemed to be in the middle of a knife fight, and manacled to a chair sat Orin, blood streaming over his face, but clearly, still lucid.

Emlyn drew on her Well, and kicked her self into the air, flying directly at the men at the table. She evaluated her targets. The man who had arrested "her", was standing with a knife in his back, and posed no threat. But the man opposite him, was radiating danger, and was already moving to defend himself. She threw her fist out and connected with his face perfectly.

The man went out like a light, rolling over head over heels backwards and Emlyn skittered onto the floor, regaining her balance. The men who had been scrabbling in the corner turned and started walking towards her, hidden foot long blades being pulled from within their pitch black robes. The man who had been grappleing with them dashed over to his wounded companion at the table.

"Watch out!", Orin yelled, straining at his chair as he instinctively tried to assist her. Emlyn spun around throwing out a high kick, just in to time to connect with another soldier she hadn't noticed before. The man grunted as he hit the wall behind him, but the distraction had worked and the three men threw themselves on Emlyn, blades flying at her viscously.

Emlyn threw herself to the side, rolling away from her foes as the swords clattered against the tiles where she had just been. Wasting no time, Emlyn jumped up the wall and grabbed an iron bracket on the wall. Her hands burned as she heaved pulling the bracket from the hard stone and projected the burning coals at her attackers.

They threw up their arms reflexively, but the burning hot coal dust fileld the air, and they screamed as it hit eyes and skin. They choked for air, and their screams resounded in the small room as the embers filled their lungs. Emlyn took a deep breath and ran at them and after a quick succession of blows the men lay on the floor.

Emlyn breathed deeply as she surveyed the destruction that surrounded her. All the cloaked men lay incapacitated on cold flagstones, but the two uniformed men that had arrested Orin and her body double remained, cowering by the table. The younger man, had pulled his sword, but clearly had no interest in using it.

"Leave them Rosie", Orins voice rang in the air, bring her back to reality after her adrenaline and Meranis fueled rage. "Release me", he then said, directing his words to the two uniformed men.

The older man sat for a second, before nodding to his companion, who pulled a ring of keys off one of the fallen guards and started to remove Orin's restraints. 

Orin rubbed his wrists as the manacles fell away. "I think it is time for us to make our escape. Again", he stated, a tired look on his face. "But I think the same goes for the two of you doesn't it?"

"We can fight our way out" Emlyn stated, eyeing the two uniformed men with suspiscion. "I wasn't spotted. And once we get back to the courtyard Meranis will guide our way".

Orin continued to look at his captors. "It seems clear that your country has turned on you. I suspect that by now that your king has been assasinated, and you will be held accountable." You could see the mechanation on their faces as they ran the evidence through their minds. They didn't want it to be true, but there was no other evidence. Even the Unbreakables wouldn't be allowed to kill a Skryer in the Skryers Hold unless they had evidence of treason.

And as Marcus thought about it, all the individual pieces seemed to fall into place. It really was obvious. The clandestine meetings, haing to bring in the Drinker by themselves. They had been set up since they entered the city. Marcus didn't want it to be true, but that didn't mean it wasn't. The only question was, where did he go from here? Fight or flight?

"Sir. My family. Do you think...?", the younger man said, clasping his hands on his head.

"No, your family is fine, trust me", the elder man said. "At least, as long as you stay away from them."

A pause and then he continued. "We flee. Follow us."

"Our bags", Orin replied as the man stood up from his chair with a grim face as he fought his internal agony. "I can give you something for the wound that will slow the bleeding and numb the pain."

"This way. I am Marcus by the way. This is Jake." the elder man said.

"Derin Tomlin, in case you didn't hear me the first fifty times", Orin said with a wicked smile.

THE END?

Epilogue.
---

"Why did you let them go?"

Orin stared out at the sunrise, growing along the dark blue horizon of the ocean. He leant against the wooden railing, taking in the salty air.

"They were no use to us in Verris", Orin replied. "We would have been forced to imprison them. And then we would be hamstrung. Whereas, outside, who knows what use they might be.

Emlyn nodded slowly. "You will have to choose your words wisely when explaining this to the comittee".

Orin sighed deeply. "I suspect that there are going to be a lot of difficult questions when we get home Emlyn. And I don't think we are going to like them."

"How can we be blamed for what happened?", Emlyn asked incredulously.

"Someone has to be. It can't be no one's fault." Orin said sadly. "But lest not worry about that now. There will be plenty of time for that in the future."

"For now, let us just be thankful", he continued.  "We could both very easily be dead". 

"Maybe you old man. I don't die so easily". Orin smiled silenty, and put his arm around her, clutching her close. "You know. I don't think we have ever simply watched a sunset together. No training, no objectives. Just stopping to enjoy its beauty and its warmth"

"Is this what it is like to watch Meranis rise?", Orin asked neutrally.

"No. She is cold, and sharp as steel. I need her with every fibre of my being. But I couldn't share her with you. She holds me jelously to her."

Emlyn stuck her arms around Orin, and he hugged her tighter as they finally headed for home.




Plot Guideline
---

Orin and Emlyn find their way to the Royal Keep, where they are working for some minor noble doing translations, scribing, perhaps managing books etc. 

At some point here, Emlyn is on a errand for Orin, or perhaps just dinner in the servants quarters, anyway she meets Robert, who is totally different character now, anyway they strike up a rapport, which will continue throughout the book.

We also meet the Princess at this point, who is cool. We like her, she has her own stuff going on. 

At this point we start seeing information from he unbreakables point of view. 

At some point soon there is a talk between THe Unbreakables, The Captain of the Guard and a shadowy plot device (read: Darth Sideous) talk about actually needing to assasinate the king, because he refuses to go to war with Verris, they have been allies for a long time now. But he is wrong, something must be done. 

Also this is a good juncture to address why they are having issues with the Scryers Guild. Some kind of interpolitical thing. Specifically, it would be of great benefit for them to get rid of Marcus

After forshadowing the problem with the Scryers, we cut to Marcus doing his thing far from home. They are on some kind of mission to do with  catching a rogue serial killer planet drinker. We will cut between them for a while as the case progresses. Not sure whether they catch him or not before they get recalled to Kris.

Orin tracks down some clues about what happened to the previous spy. they investigate, find one of his safehouses and find some encrypted documents. This is one of the first big reveals from the plot, and gives our characters some motivation on where to go from here.

Some slowdown comes after this, just them living out their lives, some time to work with Emlyn and Roberts relationship. Orin disapproving, fatherly like, typical stuff. When suddenly...

Plot event! Emlyn discovers that it was actually a Verrisian the whoel time who was trying to precipitate war. Wow, everything makes sense. But wait, it's worse than that! It appears that there is a mole inside the House of Eyes who is leaking information, and people are on the look out for spies. They are hunted now...

Turns out, it was at the Princesses orders that her father was to be killed. She was doing it because, the danger that Verris posed was too great!!!

---

Arrival, meeting people, they split up. Orin talks to Lord Tosca, Emlyn meets Mary.

The previous spy, Derrik, was a minor clerk in the treasury. Emlyn and Orin are here to retrieve any of the notes that he left behind and return them to Verris.

This will require them to live for an extended amount of time in Rens trying to find the books that could not be found by the inquisitors of Kris.

Why do they have a chance of finding something that no one else could? Because the previous spy and Orin were rivals during their early days. No one knows him better, how he thinks, what he does, where he hides.

Step 1. Blend in absolutely.
Step 2. Find ways of being able to move around the castle undetected.
Step 3. Find a way to get data about Derrik
     - Perhaps his personal effects were locked away?
     - Perhaps a key with an unopened lock?
     - Perhaps a set of ciphers that are unbroken?
Step 4. FInd the stash that Derrick left
Step 5. Follow his clues, which eventually lead to the mint

Subplots: Mary?
Daughter 1: Is being quite rebelious at the moment, snekaing out at night. Emlyn is on the roof one night (???), and sees her sneaking out of her room into town. Follows her, she runs into trouble?
