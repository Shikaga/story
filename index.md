She slipped down the corridor, lump in her throat, skin tingling with excitement and pounding terror. Her footsteps, though quiet, thundered in her head as they echoed off the bare stone walls in the labyrinthine tunnels beneath the keep. 

Approaching a corner, Emlyn dropped into the shadow of the wall and stuck her head out to check the adjacent corridor. Two guards. 

Clad in bright blue uniforms with embroidered silver lining and fine swords by their sides, they appeared stood to attention beside a non-descript door. Had they not been there, she may have missed the room entirely, Emlyn thought to herself. But their pressense, gave away the prizes within. 

Stepping out, she took on her guise of the damsel in distress. If there was one thing all military men loved, it was having helping out an woman in need. Why, who wouldn’t be thankful? And who knows how thankful she might be?

“Woah, stop right there!” the first guard yelled, stretching out his hand. “What are you doing down here?” asked the younger guard, in a friendlier tone.

“Thank goodness” Emlyn replied, putting on her most earnest voice. “I got lost, I have been wandering around for ages!”

“STOP! Not one more step, or I’ll run you through!” the senior guard shouted again, putting his right hand to the hilt of his sword, as he pulled the sheath clear of his cloak with military precision.

Hmm, so they are not too stupid then, Emlyn though to herself. Still, the die was cast and it would take far more than two guards to dissuade her from carrying out her mission.

“Sorry”, she said, almost crying, “I was just so scared”.

“That’s okay, but please stand right there, I will get one of my colleagues will assist you”, the guard replied, and moved his hand to put his whistle to his lips. 

She wasn’t going to let him get off a summoning call, and by the time he would know to signal an alarm it would be too late. Drawing the power of Meranis into her chest, she darted forward with inhuman speed and punched straight for gut.

Winded, the soldier doubled over, trying to draw his sword, but it was too late. She whipped her knee at his head and he went sprawling to the floor.

The impact was glancing, and she was suddenly off balance. Her fingers screamed for the wall, begging for purchase. Her skin went icily cold and sweat burst out on her skin, her fear of death manifesting suddenly as she straightened back up to confront her second quarry. She needn’t have worried, the younger soldier was in shock, just staring at his fallen comrade, and as he locked eyes with her he started backing away, his shaking hand going for his sword as well.

Emlyn almost felt sorry for him, simply the wrong man in the wrong place at the wrong time. If he had been born back home Verris, he might have been someone she could have become friends with, perhaps one of the scribes or valet or any of the other young men that she would talk to in the Royal Gardens back home. She almost felt sorry for him

She swung again, this time her left fist landing a solid contact on his forehead, bashing his head into wall behind him. As he slid down the wall to join his fellow slumberer on floor, Emlyn felt the shakes of the adrenaline start to take her body. She squatted down and took deep breaths, regaining her composure. As the power started to leave her, she felt the dull pain on her skin. While, Meranis provided you with strength and alacrity, it wouldn’t stop you from paying the price of your actions. She would feel the pain come tomorrow, still not as much as the soldiers at her feet, she thought.

No time to loose, she slipped the key from the bag strapped to her belt and jammed it into the door the soldiers had been guarded. She held her breath as she turned the key, but the lock fell and she stepped into the dark room beyond.

There it was, right on the desk in plain sight: a purple envelope with the red seal of Verris stamped on the back. She picked it up, stuffed it in her bag with the key, locked the door behind her and headed back down the corridor the way she had come. Ten minutes later she was back in the bright sunlight, looking at the sea surrounding the city of Ren.

Emlyn couldn’t help looking over her shoulder as she headed down the wide streets towards the docks. There was no way anyone could have seen her leave the keep. If they had, she would be dead now. Still, she couldn’t help but feel as though every eye was staring at her. 

In the hustle and bustle of the market streets, there was no way to discern a word from the inhuman yells of those trying to sell their wares, all trying to outdo each other in  volume, if not in price or quality. Yet in her, heightened state of awareness Emlyn swore that she could hear people calling her name or shouting at her to stop. 

Still, she had to get back, her master would want the envelope, and she had been so quick, he was bound to be impressed. She pushed past the throngs of people and headed down to the waterfront to the Apple Pony, the backwater inn that they were staying at while they worked. 

As she approached, she saw Orin sitting at one of the table in the sun outside the front of the inn, glass of wine in hand and an empty glass beside the half full bottle, smug smile on his face.

“What took you so long? I almost finished this bottle by myself”, Orin said humorously, a patronising smile now gripping his entire face. 

Emlyn sat down next to him, lifted the empty wine glass up to her eye and look at him through it. “You’re lying”, she said, keeping her face as straight as possible. “There is no way you could have known that I would be back as soon as I was.” They locked eyes, neither of them wanting to give away their thoughts, the locked their expressions. “That mean, that you have been here waiting for me to return, with half a bottle so that it looks like I am late and you started without me”. She placed the glass back on the table, not dropping eye contact for a moment. 

“What? Do you think I would play such juvenile games?”, Orin replied in mock offense. “I am a busy man I will have you know Rosie, I cannot simply spend my entire day thinking of clever things to say and do to trick you people I will have you know!”

Her faced cracked and she began to smile. “Of course not, Master Tomlin” she replied, emphasising the ridiculous names that they were both using as she slipped the purple envelope under the table into his outstretched hand.

“No matter”, he said waiving his hand. “I have great news Rosie” he said, continuing his charade of happy indifference. “A letter reached me this morning” Orin said, pulling the purple letter that she had just passed him so discreetly out in plain sight for all to see. “And I believe, it contains a great treasure! Shall we open it?” he inquired dramatically?

“Here Master Tomlin?” Emlyn said, somewhat surprised. “Wouldn’t it be safer to address its contents in private?”.

“Nonsense child, who would ever want to keep good news a secret?” he replied, opening the letter messily. “Why look at this”, he said showing her the piece of paper contained within. “Why it seems to be the betting slip to yesterday’s winning horse. What great fortune! Who could have been so kind as to send me such a gift?”

“Who indeed, it would appear that you have some very lucky friends” Emlyn replied, sighing to herself about the shear obviousness of it all now. 

It now seemed so obvious that Orin would never have sent her on a truly important mission on her first assignment in foreign country. Hadn’t everything been too easy? Only two guards, almost no security to speak of. She was starting to feel truly silly when Orin interrupted her train of thoughts.

“Well, this truly deserves to be celebrated, let us raise a glass together” he said as he took up the bottle and started filling the empty glass.

“Are you sure I am allowed to drink Master Tomlin”, Emlyn said looking around, slightly nervous once again.

“Of couse my dear Rosie, we are in Ren, not Verris. Why even a sixteen year old such as yourself can drink a little wine!” he said reassuringly. She didn’t think there was any point to  pointing out that it was before noon. “Now come”, Orin continued, “To good fortunes!”

“To Good fortunes” Emlyn replied and she started to sip her wine. 

Orin knocked his glass back in one full gulp and started pouring himself another glass. “Right, well it seems to me that we must be heading to the races to collect our winnings. And there is no time like the present, so let us finish off this fine bottle and be on our ways, we have a fine day of work ahead of us”.
