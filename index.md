She slipped down the corridor, lump in her throat, skin tingling with excitement and pounding terror. Her footsteps, though quiet, thundered in her head as they echoed off the bare stone walls in the labyrinthine tunnels beneath the keep. 

Approaching a corner, Emlyn dropped into the shadow of the wall and stuck her head out to check the adjacent corridor. Two guards. 

Clad in bright blue uniforms with embroidered silver lining and fine swords by their sides, they appeared stood to attention beside a non-descript door. Had they not been there, she may have missed the room entirely, Emlyn thought to herself. But their pressense, gave away the prizes within. 

Stepping out, she took on her guise of the damsel in distress. If there was one thing all military men loved, it was having helping out an woman in need. Why, who wouldn't be thankful? And who knows how thankful she might be?

"Woah, stop right there!" the first guard yelled, stretching out his hand. "What are you doing down here?" asked the younger guard, in a friendlier tone.

"Thank goodness" Emlyn replied, putting on her most earnest voice. "I got lost, I have been wandering around for ages!"

"STOP! Not one more step, or I'll run you through!" the senior guard shouted again, putting his right hand to the hilt of his sword, as he pulled the sheath clear of his cloak with military precision. Still, the die was cast and it would take far more than two guards to dissuade her from carrying out her mission.

"Sorry", she said, almost crying, "I was just so scared".

"That's okay, but please stand right there, I'll get one of my colleagues will assist you", the guard replied, and moved his hand to put his whistle to his lips. 

She wasn't going to let him get off a summoning call, and by the time he knew to signal an alarm it would be too late. Drawing the power of Meranis into her chest, she darted forward with inhuman speed and punched straight for gut.

Winded, the soldier doubled over, trying to draw his sword, but it was too late. She whipped her knee up and felt a dull thud as her knee made contact with his head.

The impact was glancing and her fingers screamed for the wall, begging for purchase as she tried to steady herself. Her skin went icily cold and sweat burst out on her skin, her fear of death manifesting suddenly as she straightened back up to see the first guard slumped unconsciously on the floor, the younger guard staring down at him in shock. As he locked eyes with her he started backing away, his shaking hand going for his sword as well.

Emlyn almost felt sorry for him. Simply the wrong man in the wrong place at the wrong time. If he had been born in Verris he might have been someone she could have become friends with, perhaps one of the scribes or valet or any of the other young men that she would talk to in the Royal Gardens back home. She almost felt sorry for him.

She swung again, this time her left fist landing a solid contact on his forehead, his head whipping back violently into wall behind him. As he slid down the wall to join his fellow slumberer on floor, Emlyn turned, checking the corridor both ways, fearing the sound of charging guards coming to assist their friends. 

But no one came. As the adrenaline started leaving her body, her body started to shake and she crouched down taking deep breaths trying to regain her composure. With the adrenaline, the power that had been infused in her body started to fade and she started to feel her body start to ache. While, Meranis provided you with strength and alacrity, it wouldn't stop you from paying the price for your actions. She would feel the pain come tomorrow, but it could be worse, she could have been one of the soldiers.

Wasting no time, she slipped a key from the bag strapped to her belt and jammed it into the door the soldiers had been guarded. She held her breath as she turned the key, but the lock fell and she stepped into the dark room beyond.

Blinking, she started to make out the room she had worked so hard to enter. Simple and practical, the room of a clerk. The simple desk and drab tapestry on the wall gave no indication of why this room would need to be guarded at all times. Still, Emlyn knew better than anyone that looks could be deceiving. 

And there it was, on the centre of the desk in plain sight: a purple envelope with the red seal of Verris stamped on the back. She picked it up, stuffed it in her bag, locked the door behind her and headed back down the corridor the way she had come. Ten minutes later she was back in the bright sunlight, looking over the sea surrounding the city of Ren.

Emlyn couldn't help looking over her shoulder as she headed down the wide streets towards the docks. There was no way anyone could have seen her leave the keep. If they had, she would be dead now. Still, she couldn't shake the feeling every eye was staring at her. 

In the hustle and bustle of the market streets, there was no way to discern a word from the inhuman yells of those trying to sell their wares, all trying to outdo each other in  volume, if not in price or quality. She slipped through the throngs of people all jostling each other as they tried to make their journeys.  

Stoping only to dissuade a young pick-pocket with a gentle nudge, she headed down to the waterfront to the Apple Pony, the backwater inn she had left just two hours previously. The  smell of saltwater and the stench of too many people in one place filled her nose as she neared the inn.

Finally freeing herself from the crowd, she saw Orin sitting at one of the tables in the sun outside the front of the inn, glass of wine in hand with an empty glass beside the bottle itself.

"What took you so long? I almost finished this bottle by myself", Orin said humorously, a patronising gripping his face. 

Emlyn sat down next to him, lifted the empty wine glass up to her eye and look at him through it. "You're lying", she said quietly, trying to keep her face as straight as possible. "There is no way you could have known that I would be back so soon". They locked eyes, neither of them wanting to give away their thoughts. "That mean, that you have been waiting here for me to return, to mock me no matter how early I was", she said, placing the glass back on the table, not dropping eye contact for a moment. 

"What? Do you think I would play such juvenile games?", Orin replied in mock offense. "I am a busy man I will have you know Rosie, I cannot simply spend my entire day thinking of clever things to say and do to trick you people I will have you know!"

Her faced cracked and she began to smile. "Of course not" she replied as she slipped the purple envelope under the table into his outstretched hand.

"No matter", he said waiving his hand. "I have great news Rosie" he said, continuing his charade of happy indifference. "A letter reached me this morning" Orin said, pulling the purple letter out in plain sight for all to see. So much for discretion. "And I believe, it contains a great treasure! Shall we open it?" he inquired dramatically?

"Here Master Tomlin?" Emlyn said, somewhat surprised. "Wouldn't it be safer to address its contents in private?"

"Nonsense child, who would ever want to keep good news a secret?" he replied, opening the letter messily. "Why look at this", he said showing her the piece of paper contained within. "It seems to be the betting slip to yesterday's winning track horse. What great fortune! Who could have been so kind as to send me such a gift?"

"Who indeed? It would appear that you have some very lucky friends" Emlyn replied, sighing to herself about the shear obviousness of it all now. 

It now seemed so obvious that Orin would never have sent her on a truly important mission on her first assignment in foreign country. Hadn't everything been too easy? Only two guards, almost no security to speak of. She was starting to feel truly silly when Orin interrupted her train of thoughts.

"And generous", he continued. "Well, this truly deserves to be celebrated, let us raise a glass together" he said as he took up the bottle and started filling the empty glass.

"If you insist" she replied, holding her glass steady as Orin started to fill it.

"Of couse my dear Rosie, we are in Ren, not Verris. Why even a sixteen year old such as yourself can drink a little wine!" he said lightly. "Now come", Orin continued, "To good fortunes!"

"To Good fortunes" Emlyn replied and she started to sip her wine. 

Orin knocked his glass back in one full gulp and started pouring himself another glass. "Right, well it seems to me that we must be heading to the races to collect our winnings. And there is no time like the present, so let us finish off this fine bottle and be on our ways, we have a fine day of work ahead of us".

"So where are we headed?"

"To meet an old acquaintance of mine" Orin replied, "A real lowlife like myself who has managed to cut a life for himself here."

"Going to catch up on old times?" Emlyn asked

"Something like that. But if there is one thing I know about Gat it is that he always knows more than he should. And unless I am very much mistaken he will be in need of a little coin"

They headed along the harbour water, once again braving the crowds. Orin took long commanding strides towards his target. He slipped through the crowds, never once stopping for others, but no one ever seemed to notice him. His easy, elegant walk didn't ask for other people to let him through, he simply did. Emlyn hurried along in his wake.

Passing through the market the mouth-watering odours of freshly cooked fish and hot bread hit Emlyn. Suddenly breakfast seemed so long ago, and the wine was leaving her light headed. Fumbling for her purse, she acquired a couple warm loafs of bread.

“Here we are” Orin announced, approaching the grimiest pub that Emlyn had ever seen. The walls, presumably once white, were were water stained to the point where Emlyn wouldn’t have been surprised if they had barnacles stuck to them. A heavily faded sign above the door announced that they were entering The Fish Wife.

The inside confirmed what the outside promised. The stench of vomit and sweat hung heavy in the air from the raucous party the night before and the endless evening of drunken debauchery before. Its current patrons were still sober, but come the end of their menial shift on the dock that evening, they would transform into a hailstorm of drunken slurs, wild threats and unskilled brawling. 

“Hey ho, Jacko” Orin exclaimed, throwing his arms in an embrace around a man who lifted him off the ground in a huge bear hug.

“So good to see you again old friend” the man replied.

Orin hadn’t lied about meeting a lowlife. Everything about the man told of his daily battles. He was large; a good half a head taller than Orin, and twice, with arms which Emlyn reckon could have picked up a warhorse. With armour on. His face held so many cuts that it could easily have been mistaken for a map of a faraway land at first glance. And some of them were clearly fresh.

But despite all this, Emlyn couldn’t help but feel affection for him. It was something about his smile, the way that it went all the way to his eyes. 

The man released Orin from his embrace, returning him to the floor, where they started shaking hands. 

“Gonna be sundown by the time you too are done greeting each other” said the barman sarcastically.

“Right you are Tom” <<Barmen are always called Tom>> said the man. “Please, two of your best beers and a…” he said trailing off as he made eye contact with Emlyn.

“Oh how rude of me” said Orin “Jack let me introduce Rosie, my niece. Rosie this is my old friend Jack”

“Hey who are you calling old?” Jack retorted “You are old enough to be her father!”

“Well yes, like I said, she is my niece”

“Well what will your niece be having?” the barman interrupted, pulling down the glasses off the shelf behind him. “And I hope she can pay for you all, I can’t remember the last time Jack paid his tab”

“Come now, I thought that was water under the bridge Tommy”

“Beer down your throat more like. And not a copper piece to show for it” the barman replied

“Don’t you worry, these are on me” said Orin placing a silver coin on the bar. The coin disappeared into the barman’s hand so fast that Emlyn could have sworn he must have been a magician.

“I’ll have a half” Emlyn said hopefully.

“You most certainly will not!” Orin said light heartedly. “What would your mother say? Why I doubt, she would ever let me under her roof again, if she heard I had let you drink!”. 

Jack laughed good naturedly. “Go on Ben, just a half”

“Absolutely not, she will have cup of tea”

“’Fraid you out of luck mate” the barman replied. “Does this look like Queens garden party? Best I can do is water if the ladies not drinking”

“Water it is then”.

They took their drinks and sat down at an empty table. They started talking about old times and what were they doing in Ren. Orin told the lies they had practiced so many times. Jacks eyes betrayed that he could tell something didn’t quite add up, but he never said a word.

Once they had finished their drinks Orin leant his head in conspiratorially and started speaking in a hushed whisper.

“We are going to have a private talk, stay here Rosie, we will be back in a little bit” said Orin.

“Not a chance old friend”, Jack broke in. “It has been okay while I have been here but the second I leave half this bar is going to start making a move on this beautiful flower of yours”

“I can take care of myself” Emlyn said defiantly.

“I am sure you can. But I am sure you two don’t want to draw attention to yourselves” he said conspiratorially.

“He’s right Rosie, why don’t you go back to the market, we will meet you there in half a bell.”

They left the pub and Orin and Jack headed into a back alley on the left while Emlyn slowly made her way back to the market.
