Prologue
---
The usual quiet and serenity of the palace had given way to the anxiety and fear that always accompanied uncertainty. The bells rang out loudly, signalling an attack, but there were no enemy soldiers, no conquering armies. 

Captain Jenkins, the first of the Kings Guard, rushed through the ornate passages, their usual pristine cleanliness dissolved into disarray. Whispers and shouting echoed through the hallways in equal measure, members of the royal household staring anxiously from their chamber doors and holding onto each other for comfort.

He passed couple of guards who were half way down the corridor, drawn away from their post the commotion. "Stand at your post!" he shouted, and they jumped backwards, retaking their position beside the door. 

"Oh Captain, there you are!" another soldier declared, in relief, forgetting all formalities.

"Lead the way Seargent Kyle", the Captain responded, putting enough emphasis in his voice to remind him to maintain his discipline.

"The King's chamber's Sir", he Seargent Kyle replied, and The Captain placed a hard look on his face and marched onwards.

They continued on, deep into the keep, towards the safest of places, the inner sanctum where the King's chambers lay. 

Where was the discipline?, The Captain pondered. These were meant to be the best of the best, the king's personal guard. And yet here they were, no one sure of what they should be doing, milling around like chickens with their heads cut off.

"I will have order here!", The Captain roared and each guard there stood to attention right where they were. He gave orders quickly as he walked onwards into the kings personal rooms. Once he had issued the undisciplined halfwits their orders, he entered the kings chambers.

He looked upon the room. Carnage. Everything in the room had been tossed aside, the clear and resonating signs of a struggle were clear to see. Vases smashed on the ground, one of the bed curtains had been pulled and now hung from one sad hook. Blood, there was so much blood. From the bed, to the floor to the wall, a thick trail of life stretched across the room.

And at the end of the trail, slumped against the wall: The King. He was covered in more than a few blade marks all along his left arm and face, and huge gouge sat in his chest, just below his heart. 

He must have fought bravely. The thought flashed through the Captain's head. At seventy years old, for him to fight back against an assassin's blade, when attacked in the middle of the night? There are some skills that a warrior never forgets.

But it had all been in vain. From the second the assassin had penetrated their defences the king had been dead. What did they do wrong? Not enough guards? Not enough walls?

There was no point second guessing yourself. The guard crossed to the bed and took up a sheet and covered the kings naked body with it, just as an old man barrelled into the room, out of breath, gasping.

"I am afraid that you are too late Doctor Virchow", he said as the old man entered. The First Doctor of the Realm looked so odd. 

His usual illustrious clothing, with velvet and golden thread embroidery were replaced this evening by a cheap full length shift of cloth. He wasn't wearing any shoes. Funny how something like that seems so odd at a time like that The Captain thought.

The surgeon crossed slowly to the king side, his bare feet wading into the large pool of blood around the king. He knealt down and put his hands to the back of his hand to the kings face, and then placed his palms all the way down his chest and to his legs. Finally coming to terms with the fatal truth, he sighed deeply and stood back.

The Captain placed his hand lightly on the old man's shoulder. 

"We knew each other since we were kids", the doctor said quietly. "My father used to bring me with him when he came to examine his father. We used play together sometimes."

"We will get whoever did this Rufus" The Captain said, but the old surgeon just looked away. They sat down on the bed, and the surgeon just looked at his feet.

"Sir", a guard said, standing to attention.

"Report", The Captain clipped.

"We have them sir, the assassin"

"Where?" The Captain asked, standing up suddenly.

"They are being taken to the cells as we speak. Found unconscious in the West Gallery sir, knife still in hand"

"Let's go" he said, and The Captain marched down towards the dungeons, as a group of apprentice surgeons charged past him to the king chambers, bags of equipment in hand. He could hear Rufus talking to them quietly as he marched to the dungeons.

As he walked down the wide passages of the royal keep, each of the guards stood to attention, showing the respect due the Captain of the Guard. Some of them looked so young, hardly ready for the war that was now inevitable.

It hardly seemed fair at all, being sent into the fray, barely more than children. But had he not been that age, even younger, when the last war broke out? Hadn't he done everything he could to enlist? To defend the kingdom and honour the king?

Somehow it didn't seem the same anymore, forty years had changed him beyond recognition. His many commendations for battles won and victories taken seemed a distant memory now. The events of another man's life.

But if it was going to be war, he was going to ensure that they were going to win. And the first step was to find out who was behind this heinous crime.

Descending the cold stone steps, the steel gates clinked open as he approached them. They were deep underground now, fires burnt in brackets attached all along the world, the only light in a world of perpetual darkness.

"The prisoner is ready for questioning Captain", the ancient jailor said, a toothless grin on his face, clearly eager to have a new victim to maltreat. 

"No one else has spoken to the him yet?", the captain asked.

"No sir, the assasin only just regained consciousness" the guard said, with a hint of laughter in his voice. "But I think you might find them a little different from what you are expecting Captain", he said, finding his key on his giant ring of keys.

The jailor turned the long key in the lock and swung the cell door open and the Captain looked in the door. Two guards sat either side of a table, and the prisoner sat, face down on the table, manacles snaking from the floor to the his limbs.

Sitting down at the table, the Captain loomed and slowly cracked his knuckles trying to be as imposing as he could. "So, we are about to have a little chat", The Captain said, nodding to one of the guards. The grabbed and the prisoners head yanked his head off the table roughly.

A sixteen year old girl, hair matted to her face with sweat, stared into The Captains head.

One Week Earlier



Put some stuff in here. Well, lets just have an entirely different chapter maybe. I dunno, does it really matter?

Wasting no time, she slipped a key from the bag strapped to her belt and jammed it into the door the soldiers had been guarded. She held her breath as she turned the key, but the lock fell and she stepped into the dark room beyond.

Blinking, she started to make out the room she had worked so hard to enter. Simple and practical, the room of a clerk. The simple desk and drab tapestry on the wall gave no indication of why this room would need to be guarded at all times. Still, Emlyn knew better than anyone that looks could be deceiving. 

And there it was, on the centre of the desk in plain sight: a purple envelope with the red seal of Verris stamped on the back. She picked it up, stuffed it in her bag, locked the door behind her and headed back down the corridor the way she had come. Ten minutes later she was back in the bright sunlight, looking over the sea surrounding the city of Ren. 

2.
----
Emlyn couldn't help looking over her shoulder as she headed down the wide streets towards the docks. There was no way anyone could have seen her leave the keep. If they had, she would be dead now. Still, she couldn't shake the feeling every eye was staring at her. 

In the hustle and bustle of the market streets, there was no way to discern a word from the inhuman yells of those trying to sell their wares, all trying to outdo each other in  volume, if not in price or quality. She slipped through the throngs of people all jostling each other as they tried to make their journeys.  

Stoping only to dissuade a young pick-pocket with a gentle nudge, she headed down to the waterfront to the Apple Pony, the backwater inn she had left just two hours previously. The  smell of saltwater and the stench of too many people in one place filled her nose as she neared the inn.

Finally freeing herself from the crowd, she saw Orin sitting at one of the tables in the sun outside the front of the inn, glass of wine in hand with an empty glass beside the bottle itself.

"What took you so long? I almost finished this bottle by myself", Orin said humorously, a patronising grin gripping his face. 

Emlyn sat down next to him, lifted the empty wine glass up to her eye and look at him through it. "You're lying", she said quietly, trying to keep her face as straight as possible. "There is no way you could have known that I would be back so soon". They locked eyes, neither of them wanting to give away their thoughts. "That mean, that you have been waiting here for me to return, to mock me no matter how early I was", she said, placing the glass back on the table, not dropping eye contact for a moment. 

"What? Do you think I would play such juvenile games?", Orin replied in mock offense. "I am a busy man I will have you know Rosie, I cannot simply spend my entire day thinking of clever things to say and do to trick you people I will have you know!"

Her faced cracked and she began to smile. "Of course not" she replied as she slipped the purple envelope under the table into his outstretched hand.

"No matter", he said waiving his hand. "I have great news Rosie" he said, continuing his charade of happy indifference. "A letter reached me this morning" Orin said, pulling the purple letter out in plain sight for all to see. So much for discretion. "And I believe, it contains a great treasure! Shall we open it?" he inquired dramatically?

"Here Master Tomlin?" Emlyn said, somewhat surprised. "Wouldn't it be safer to address its contents in private?"

"Nonsense child, who would ever want to keep good news a secret?" he replied, opening the letter messily. "Why look at this", he said showing her the piece of paper contained within. "It seems to be the betting slip to yesterday's winning track horse. What great fortune! Who could have been so kind as to send me such a gift?"

"Who indeed? It would appear that you have some very lucky friends" Emlyn replied, sighing to herself about the shear obviousness of it all now. 

It now seemed so obvious that Orin would never have sent her on a truly important mission on her first assignment in foreign country. Hadn't everything been too easy? Only two guards, almost no security to speak of. She was starting to feel truly silly when Orin interrupted her train of thoughts.

"And generous", he continued. "Well, this truly deserves to be celebrated, let us raise a glass together" he said as he took up the bottle and started filling the empty glass.

"If you insist" she replied, holding her glass steady as Orin started to fill it.

"Of couse my dear Rosie, we are in Ren, not Verris. Why even a sixteen year old such as yourself can drink a little wine!" he said lightly. "Now come", Orin continued, "To good fortunes!"

"To Good fortunes" Emlyn replied and she started to sip her wine. 

Orin knocked his glass back in one full gulp and started pouring himself another glass. "Right, well it seems to me that we must be heading to the races to collect our winnings. And there is no time like the present, so let us finish off this fine bottle and be on our ways, we have a fine day of work ahead of us".

3.
----
They were moving quickly through the streets, back towards the keep.  The cobbled streets were already starting to show signs of the detritus that builds up anywhere that sees thousands of people and animals every day.  Orin rummaged through his satchel as he walked, drawing things out apparently at random, with Emlyn a pace or so behind.  The bonhomie had melted away as soon as they got out of sight of the inn.

"It occurs to me darling Rosie," he said "that your efficiency in completing your errand may have complicated things."

"What do you mean?"

"In the years you've been running errands for me, you have learnt many things.  How many of those things would you say you used today?"

Emlyn dodged a group of children wanting to shine her shoes.  She didn't really know what he was driving at, so she stayed quiet.

"As I thought.  Let's come at this from a different angle. You completed your errand *skillfully* and quickly, correct?"  She nodded. "So, I am pleased with that. However, what is important to me other than efficiency?"

"Being the last at the table."

Orin barked a laugh. "Good answer. Yes indeed, being the last at the table. And seated at that table with us at the moment is our worst enemy." He paused in his flow to turn a corner. "Stop it!" he said suddenly.

"What?"

"You're imagining what he might look like." Orin spun suddenly, grabbing her shoulders and staring into her eyes. Even though she had known him for years and had seen him do this before, it still gave her the chills for a moment at how completely he had transformed himself with the things he had taken from the satchel as he walked. Only the slate grey eyes were the same. "I have not met him, you have not met him, but we know he's there, and he looks like the serving girl at the inn, or the market seller behind his stall.  If you ever do meet him face to face, he will look like whatever he wants to look like.  We didn't have to worry about him so much when we were in Verris, but now as I told you earlier, we are in Ren.  Quickly, tell me two things you would not want him to know about you."

"What I look like and where I'm staying."

"Both things that we don't want him to know, yes, but I'm thinking more fundamental.  Firstly, that you exist at all. Secondly that you are a *drinker*."  He almost hissed the last word.  "Over there is an inn that soldiers on the way back from their shifts occasionally have a beer in.  Draw your cloak around you, go in and sit in the corner on the left.  Don't let anyone see your face."

Emlyn had been waiting in her corner for only a few minutes before Orin came in with a young soldier.  They seemed the best of friends, although the younger soldier walked a little unsteadily and had a bandage around his head.  They sat at the booth on the opposite side of the room, but she found that by moving around a little, she could find a spot where the acoustics let her hear very clearly what he was saying.

"This? Oh it's not as bad as it looks.  I can't talk about it really", he was saying, "my officer told me that this stuff was all very hush hush."  He took a sip of the tankard he'd been given. Orin said something, to which he snorted.

"He was beaten up by a girl you say?  Some of them are surprisingly strong, as I've had reason to know myself.  Do you think there might be a girl planet drinker around?"

Orin said something she couldn't make out, but the sound changed.  She looked across, and saw the young soldier leaning away from Orin, his face contorting with fear.  She moved around until she could hear what Orin was saying:

"not dead right now is because your uncle whom I know to be a solid man vouched for you.  I don't think you understand the gravity of the situation you're in. There's not a man in this city who wouldn't kill you for the reward that would be placed on your head were they to know that you occasionally do jobs for me, and there's not a man in Verris who wouldn't kill you if they knew you were placing my mission here in danger through loose talk. If I have to come and find you again, it will be the last time.  Do I make my meaning clear?"

The young soldier seemed to have something wrong with his throat.  Orin stood up, slapped him jovially on the shoulder, and walked out.  Emlyn waited a short while then followed.

4.
----
Apparently scaring the soldier had lightened Orin's mood.  He whistled as he walked.

"Was that really necessary?" Emlyn asked.

"You tell me.  I didn't realise you had a phylactery, so I rather expected you to use a little more guile on that one, and if you had, that soldier probably wouldn't have needed reminding that he should keep his opinions to himself. What I hoped you learnt from that is that sometimes it avoids complications to use less direct methods, and the less that you reveal about yourself the better."

"How about the lesson 'if I want something done a particular way, I should explain that before sending someone to do it'?"

"Now *Rosie*, I'm currently in a good mood. Let's keep it that way."

She stayed silent for a while.  "So where are we headed?"

"To meet an old acquaintance of mine" Orin replied, "A real lowlife like myself who has managed to cut a life for himself here."

"Going to catch up on old times?" Emlyn asked

"Something like that. But if there is one thing I know about Ben it is that he always knows more than he should. And unless I am very much mistaken he will be in need of a little coin"

They headed along the harbour water, once again braving the crowds. Orin took long commanding strides towards his target. He slipped through the crowds, never once stopping for others, but no one ever seemed to notice him. His easy, elegant walk didn't ask for other people to let him through, he simply did. Emlyn hurried along in his wake.

Passing through the market the mouth-watering odours of freshly cooked fish and hot bread hit Emlyn. Suddenly breakfast seemed so long ago, and the wine was leaving her light headed. Fumbling for her purse, she acquired a couple warm loafs of bread.

"Here we are" Orin announced, approaching the grimiest pub that Emlyn had ever seen. The walls, presumably once white, were were water stained to the point where Emlyn wouldn't have been surprised if they had barnacles stuck to them. A heavily faded sign above the door announced that they were entering The Fish Wife.

The inside confirmed what the outside promised. The stench of vomit and sweat hung heavy in the air from the raucous party the night before and the endless evening of drunken debauchery before. Its current patrons were still sober, but come the end of their menial shift on the dock that evening, they would transform into a hailstorm of drunken slurs, wild threats and unskilled brawling. 

"Hey ho, Jacko" Orin exclaimed, throwing his arms in an embrace around a man who lifted him off the ground in a huge bear hug.

"So good to see you again old friend" the man replied.

Orin hadn't lied about meeting a lowlife. Everything about the man told of his daily battles. He was large; a good half a head taller than Orin, and twice, with arms which Emlyn reckon could have picked up a warhorse. With armour on. His face held so many cuts that it could easily have been mistaken for a map of a faraway land at first glance. And some of them were clearly fresh.

But despite all this, Emlyn couldn't help but feel affection for him. It was something about his smile, the way that it went all the way to his eyes. 

The man released Orin from his embrace, returning him to the floor, where they started shaking hands. 

"Gonna be sundown by the time you too are done greeting each other" said the barman sarcastically.

"Right you are Tom" <<Barmen are always called Tom>> said the man. "Please, two of your best beers and a…" he said trailing off as he made eye contact with Emlyn.

"Oh how rude of me" said Orin "Jack let me introduce Rosie, my niece. Rosie this is my old friend Jack"

"Hey who are you calling old?" Jack retorted "You are old enough to be her father!"

"Well yes, like I said, she is my niece"

"Well what will your niece be having?" the barman interrupted, pulling down the glasses off the shelf behind him. "And I hope she can pay for you all, I can't remember the last time Jack paid his tab"

"Come now, I thought that was water under the bridge Tommy"

"Beer down your throat more like. And not a copper piece to show for it" the barman replied

"Don't you worry, these are on me" said Orin placing a silver coin on the bar. The coin disappeared into the barman's hand so fast that Emlyn could have sworn he must have been a magician.

"I'll have a half" Emlyn said hopefully.

"You most certainly will not!" Orin said light heartedly. "What would your mother say? Why I doubt, she would ever let me under her roof again, if she heard I had let you drink!". 

Jack laughed good naturedly. "Go on Ben, just a half"

"Absolutely not, she will have cup of tea"

"'Fraid you out of luck mate" the barman replied. "Does this look like Queens garden party? Best I can do is water if the ladies not drinking"

"Water it is then".

They took their drinks and sat down at an empty table. They started talking about old times and what were they doing in Ren. Orin told the lies they had practiced so many times. Jacks eyes betrayed that he could tell something didn't quite add up, but he never said a word.

Once they had finished their drinks Orin leant his head in conspiratorially and started speaking in a hushed whisper.

"We are going to have a private talk, stay here Rosie, we will be back in a little bit" said Orin.

"Not a chance old friend", Jack broke in. "It has been okay while I have been here but the second I leave half this bar is going to start making a move on this beautiful flower of yours"

"I can take care of myself" Emlyn said defiantly.

"I am sure you can. But I am sure you two don't want to draw attention to yourselves" he said conspiratorially.

"He's right Rosie, why don't you go back to the market, we will meet you there in half a bell."

They left the pub and Orin and Jack headed into a back alley on the left while Emlyn slowly made her way back to the market.

5.
----
Emlyn wandered around the market, dragging her heels, trying not to look at everything too quickly and be forced to go around again. She couldn't help feeling slightly left out when Orin went off by himself. She understood the importance of discretion. Informants were a lot more open when they were talking to people that they knew well. And Orin would fill her in on any of the important details later.

But that didn't make it any less annoying. There was something about being a spy, you craved information, no matter how unimportant or inconsequential. And there was nothing more galling than being told that there was something that you couldn't know. 

Finding a low sea wall, Emlyn sat down and pulled a book from her coat pocket. A particularly dry account of the history of Kingdom of Kris, it's capital Ren and their countless wars against Verris. The historian was of course completely biased. 

The evil of the Kingdom of Kris held knew no bounds. While noble knights of Verris fought with bravery and cunning, the evil forces of Kris we sinful to their bone, raping and pillaging their way across the lands. 

But that was nothing to say of their King and Queen. A family so evil no one had dared challenge them for hundreds of years, for fear of their retribution.

The line between truth and lies were subtle. A man who is described a murderous warlord in one book, will be declared a defender of the innocent in the next. Both could be true.

Of course, whether they were good or bad, just or malevolent, didn't really interest Emlyn. Her years of training in the Royal Palace had drilled the importance of following orders.

What would happen if you told your arm to move, and it decided not to? Or if your one leg decided to walk and the other did not? To work effectively, your legs must trust the orders from your head assuring it that there were no cliffs ahead. 

Kingdoms were just like people. Your mines and farms were your legs, providing you with the your means to propel you through life. Your Armies were like your arms, defending you from others.

And she was the Eyes of the King. The Royal Spies provided The Crown all the information it needed to make the life and death decision the king made every day. Where armies were being marched, supplies being shipped, alliances being broken; all these were the coin of espionage. And of course, more valuable than all of these combined was information about Planet Drinkers.

Few in number, remnants of the ancient royal families, Planet Drinkers were ultimate weapons in hands of every royal family. Their ancient blood gave them powers beyond imagining. The power to fight, hide, <<blah blah>> on a super human level. Even a faintest whisper of a young prince being a Drinker would be enough for a battalion of spies to be deployed to investigate the claims.

Of course the history books had loads to say about the Planet Drinkers. How the unusual celestial order of the planets, the source of all Drinkers power, had allowed a previously weak nation to rise to extrodinary heights, before being destroyed as the planets moved inexorably along their paths allowing another nation to rise.

For Emlyn, being a Planet Drinker had never been much of a blessing. She supposed it could have been worse, had she been born in Kris, she would likely have been murdered, and her entire family with her if it had been discovered that a Drinker had been born so far outside of the royal line.

Still, in Verris drinkers were considered property of the crown, tools to be used, sharpened and maintained, to be deployed in defence of the kingdom at a moment's notice. 

She knew that she should be happy. To be placed in the House of Eyes was one of best outcomes she could have received. Provided as a precious resource, she was one of the only to Drinkers of the House. At the age of 6 she had been assigned to Orin one of the most accomplished spies in the kingdom. Tough not a Drinker, at 35 Orin was at the peak of his fame and power. Well, fame as far as spies could achieve; it was well known among the Council of Elders that Orin was the man to get the job done. But knowing that is strength would soon begin to wane, he knew that it was time to take on an apprentice.

Of course, she showed nothing but contempt to Orin when she first came under his tutelage. Young and scared, her 6 year old self hated everything and everyone; the kingdom for their unjust laws, Orin for his imprisonment of her and most of all her mother, for not protecting her.

Thinking about that time just embarrassed her. It now seemed so clear to her why things had to be the way they were. All things considered her life had turned out rather well. She was strong, fit and well taught. She was well thought of by the House and given ten years she could be the youngest person to ever be elected to the Council of Eyes. Her mother was doing well, and they saw each other often enough and, most important of all, Emlyn had a job that she loved.

There was nothing quite as exciting as trespassing where you weren't wanted. The thrill of game, the excitement of knowing what you shouldn't; it was unlike anything else, a drug that you couldn't duplicate. 

A sudden roar of noise jolted Emlyn from her thoughts. The crowd started boil as everyone started talking at once.

"They're coming. The king is coming!" someone yelled, nearly hysterical, running down the road, informing everyone he came across.

The people all stopped what they were doing and started to head to the road.

"You there, get off your ass and salute your King!", yelled a guard, marching through the market, following the path that the man before him had just taken.

Emlyn locked eyes with the guard confrontationally, before putting her book away and slowly started walking to the road. The guard stared her down, before continuing on his way shaking his head and urging other passers-by to head to the road.

She squeezed past the people to get to the front of the throng standing on both sides of the road. Following the examples of all the other citizens, Emlyn put her fist to her chest, saluting as the first horses of the royal procession came down the street.

It was a fine sight, twenty knights in full parade regalia headed the procession, followed by twenty of the kings personal guard. And then the kings personal carriage passed by. 

Painstakingly crafted, it glittered like a jewel in the bright sunlight. It had been carved to perfection, and covered entirely in gold gilt. Tiger motifs were present through-out the carriage, the official seal of Kris used to point where it became more vulgar than impressive.

The curtains were drawn; no doubt the king didn't want to see the dockworker, merchants, beggars and other lowlifes on his way to his ship.

As the carriage passed another twenty knights brought up the rear. Their searching eyes scanned the crowds, just waiting for an excuse to "deal" with someone who stepped out of line. 

One guard in particular stood out to her. He locked eyes directly with her. As he rode, his persistent gaze held her in place, and worry started to fill her. Did he recognize her? Had she been seen by someone in keep?

Emlyn felt a rough hand grab her shoulder.

"Hey" a voice yelled behind her

6.
---
"Ahhh", Emlyn yelled jumping a foot in the air, her heart racing. Wresting herself free, she turned on her attacker, a look of fear and danger on her face.

 "Woah, calm down", the man said, taking a step back, palms raised in a calming tone. He was handsome, Emlyn thought, and not as old as she had thought at first glance. In fact looking at him, he was hardly more than a boy, probably just a few years older than her. But his tallness and his manner made him seem a bit older.

"Sorry, didn't mean to startle you" he said, reassuringly, "I was just trying to get your attention."

Emlyn stared at him for a moment. She noticed that she was suddenly holding the power of Meranis, her instinct to save herself overriding her years of meditation. She took a deep breath, letting the power of Meranis leave her. "What do you want?" she said, straightening her hair unconsciously.

"Oh sorry, I just noticed what you were reading, ‘The Antiquity of Krisdom' by Engust Dalson?' he said questioningly.

"What?"

"Err, the book. That you are reading. It's right there, in your pocket" he said pointing.

"Yeah so?", said Emlyn coldly, still staring at him.

"Well, it is just so seldom that I see other young people intetrerseted in history. In fact, now I think of it, you are the only person I have ever seen read such a book who is under 50"

"What are you trying to say?"

"Nothing!", he said defensively, suddenly becoming a little flustered. "I just thought it would be nice to talk to another young person for a change."

Emlyn's heart was finally starting to calm down after her scare. She knew she really shouldn't feel resentment towards him. It wasn't really his fault that she had been put on edge by one of guards. In fact, thinking about it, he hadn't even really grabbed her that hard, she had just been so nervous that the slightest touch had sent her into a wild panic.

She took another deep breath, "I'm sorry, let's start this again. My name is Rosie"

"Robert, good to meet you Rosie" he said, putting out his hand for a handshake, a look of relief on his face as she took his hand.

"So you like history do you Robert?" she said with a slight tone of mischief. "Well then, I am sure that you can tell me what the primary cause of the ‘Revolution of Adlard' was."

"Of course, though it depends upon which historian you put the most faith in." he said knowingly. "Now as far as I am concerned Paler gives the most accurate account of the revolution, as he puts the primary cause to be Kings outlawing of weapon exports to the South Sea Islands.

The people of Adlard obviously being primarily metalworkers were hit very hard by this in a year where the crops failed. Suddenly finding themselves without food and with a surplus of weapons, the good people of Adlard decided that perhaps they were perfectly capable of governing themselves"

Robert's had a perfect oratory voice, Emlyn thought as they walked towards the sea together. When he stated something, he made you believe it as fact. There was no doubt in his voice that was he said was correct. 

"So what do you make of Cheapers account of the revolution being primarily an idealistic one, brought on by a belief in self-government?"

"Bah", replied Robert discountingly. "Cheaper is, as usual, simply pushing his own agenda, creating martyrs for his cause and evil warlords out of anyone who looked at him the wrong way."

They sat on a bench by the harbour wall, looking back at the market, as the hustle and bustle of people resumed. Looking down curved wall, Emlyn could still make out the stiring pattern of people moving to attention as the Royal Procession passed by them. She wondered quite how a King got to be so revered so that everyone would drop what they were doing when he passed by. I mean, in Kris of course it was law. But it had not always been so. Once, the people of Kris had done so out of pure admiration. A national love for a single man who had done everything that he could for his people. 

Of course, eventually the king passed away and his son took over. Well, his son was a great man as well, why shouldn't they show him the respect they had shown his father? And over the generations the sign of respect had become so ingrained in their culture that to not do it would be a sign of defiance. And in this age, no one defied the King.

"So yeah, as far as I am concerned, even then you should take Cheaper's accounts with a great deal of salt" Robert said, clearly concluding his point which Emlyn had completely missed.

"Hmmm, well it definitely seems that you have an elementary knowledge of some history" she said defying his proud tone. "My turn"

They continued talking, quizzing each other on books they had read, their knowledge of ancient kings and queens long past and other minutia of history. Emlyn suddenly found herself laughing, feeling truly happy for the first time since leaving home. Rob had an easy going attitude, and a quick wit to boot.

Suddenly looking up she saw Orin coming down the street.

"Oh no, look at the time!" she said, looking up at the clock tower which rose over the harbour. "I've gotta go, I'm going to be late"

"Wait, where can I meet you again?" Robert said, grabbing her hand suddenly anxious. Emlyn stared down at where he had grasped her, and he suddenly let go, looking away.

"Err, how about here? Tomorrow, at the sixth bell after noon."

"I will be there"

Emlyn could feel Roberts eyes on her as she briskly walked in Orin's direction. Silently signalling Orin to follow her, she ducked down a sidestreet and out of sight.

"Meet someone?" Orin asked.

"Just some guy at the market"

"Excellent. Well, I have some news. Best that we were on our way" Orin said, striding off towards their Inn, with Emlyn following close behind.

They sat at their small desk in their room at the Apple Pony, the windows flung open to try and entice any small night breeze into the humid room. The desk had been pulled from its original position facing the wall and placed in the centre of the room. The desk was covered by a large map of the city of Ren and a variety of documents sat on top of that, with Orin's smoking box holding down one end of the map and an empty candlestick holding down the other.

"So, it appears that events move quickly without us. Kris is preparing for war." Orin said. "And I suspect that this fact is already well known in Verris by now, but in our travels, we must have missed the message."

Orin took his pipe from his pocket and slowly and methodically started to fill it it. Once he was satisfied that it was just the way he wanted, he stood up, pulled a taper from the mantle and lit his pipe from a candle.

"Our mission has not changed. Whatever developments may have occurred, there is no way for The House to contact as, and they are relying on us to do our jobs quickly and effectively. Once we have achieved our objectives, we can return home via the fastest possible route and deliver our reports"

Orin started to suck on his pipe thoughtfully. Emlyn just sat, waiting for him to finish. When he was in this mood, it was best to let him speak out loud and wait for him to ask her a direct question.

"To wit, we need to somehow put our hands on as much information about the current state of their military as soon as possible. Now, as it so happens, before we arrived, I got wind of a man who might be happy to provide us with such information, for the right price that is."

Orin pulled on his pipe again, his eyes looking over the glowing bowl conspiratorially. Here it comes, Emlyn thought, he is wondering whether I have figured it out for myself yet. But she was still at a loss as to what things Orin expected her to have put together.

"This man, a senior quartermaster as it so happens, has a thing for the horses. A fine distraction for most men, but for some, a disease worse than any plague".

Everything suddenly clicked. "Yes, a man like that can get into quite a bit of debt, loose every last penny he has. And then, take more than a few pennies that he doesn't have, and make a bet which will put all his debt straight." Emlyn explained with glee.  

"Finding himself so far over the edge, any man would give away a little information to someone who could save him from his fate. You basically had a sure thing, if you pardon the pun. But then his horse won! What were the chances?"

Orin was smilling at her now, his proud eyes lit by his pipe, letting her explain her brilliant deductions.

"Of course you couldn't have that. It was necessary to ensure that he would misplace his betting card before he could cash it. And then he would have no choice but to take your hand"

"No choice?" asked Orin. "Why wouldn't he just claim that the money he took from the coffers was stolen by the break in this morning?"

"Hmm". Yes, that would be the logical choice of action, Emlyn thought. By breaking in I gave him the perfect excuse to explain away any money that he may have lifted from the military coffers. "I don't know"

"Hmmm" Orin said, imitating her contemplative look. "Well, why don't you think about it some more. See if you can figure it out".

Orin shuffled through the papers on his desk, holding them up, trying to read them in the dim light of the room. "Ahhh, here we go". TBC.

The city looked different at night. Gone were the beggars, merchants and pedestrians, trying to make their way through the packed streets. Now the city belonged to the footpads and criminals, hoping to get lucky and stumble onto those fortunate enough to return from the pub with money still in their pockets.

The city guard took their patrols through the wide boulevards of the inner city, ensuring that no one disturbed the lives of those rich enough to pay the exorbitant rates the noble families set. But, beyond that you were on your own. Of course, that was good if you were one of those people who were up to no good. And Orin and Emlyn most certainly fell into that category.

The trick with travelling at night, was to look like neither a criminal nor a victim, a difficult balance to strike. More than anything, it was how you carried yourselves. As they walked down the road you could see the brigands and ruffians muttering to themselves, before noticing swords and the look of absolute self-confidence that Orin and Emlyn held, and decided that they wanted none of it.

Orin navigated them through the streets and allies with his ever present coolness. He finally stopped, looked around for anyone who might have noticed them. "Okay, here we are. Our quartermaster is in the house with the red door", Orin whispered, indicating. "As we have already discussed, there is no assurance that this isn't a trap. You know what to do if everything goes south?". Emlyn nodded. "Okay, let's take a quick look around and then I will go for it. You stay here and warn me if anything happens."

They took a few minutes to look around the neighbourhood, before Orin crossed his way to the door and knocked firmly. A few seconds went by and the door cracked open. A face appeared before swinging the door open to admit Orin and closed behind him.

Suddenly feeling very alone, Emlyn looked around rapidly for anyone who might be approaching, but the street was dead quite. If she had been dressed in her usual dresses she probably wouldn't have lasted two seconds on the street before every brigand was after her. But disguised as boy with a sword at her side anyone who looked at her would see a mercenary, if a short one, no doubt waiting to escort their master during his shady dealings.

Funny thing Emlyn thought, that people would make such judgements based on your looks. If she had was stood here as a woman, she would be seen as easy pickings, a lamb to the slaughter. And yet, disguised as a mercenary, she didn't reflect even a candle of her true threat. A mask on a mask. A weapon, disguised as a woman, disguised as a mercenary.

Emlyn watched from the shadows as a group of drunks heading home together, half stumbling half crawling to down the street. Their voices grew louder as they passed her, threats of violence interspersed with drunken slurs of fraternal love and raucous laughter. As they passed and voices started to disappear in the foggy night air, the door cracked open again and Orin emerged, and headed back in the direction of the inn.

"So, how did that go?" Emlyn asked as she caught up with him.

"Very well, for all parties involved. We have some very boring documents and our quartermaster will no longer be in the debt of men who break fingers." Orin chuckled to himself. "Well, I must say, I can't think of the last time I have had such a productive day. Let us get home before anything spoils it.

6 days to go

When Emlyn woke the sun was already well over the horizon, probably about eighth bell. She rose from her bed and washed in the basin of cold water before donning her favourite red dress and combing her hair thoroughly. This done, she added her matching butterfly hairclips to hold back her hair from falling in her face.

Leaving her room she found Orin at the desk pouring over a red book filled with numbers and figures. His glasses looked odd on him, as though he was a different person entirely. Older, more learned. Without looking up he moved his fountain pen from where it hovered over his own book of pristinely copied notes and placed it back on the table and closed the bottle of ink. 

"Breakfast?" he inquired. 

"Sounds good." Emlyn replied, suddenly aware of how hungry she was.

They headed down to the common room and the sat down at their usual table and were approached immediately by a waiter. Orin ordered their usual breakfast.



"It is amazing how much information can be held in numbers Roise" Orin said after the waiter had retreated a sufficient distance. "Why, some would think that the fact that 2 tons of iron were shipped to a bell founder was some management slip up. I see cannons, being produced faster than the military can handle it". 

And what would you make of a constant increase in the amount of grain being delivered to the local barracks? Or the sudden jump in gold being sent to the provinces of Kris?"

They all point to war. A war the likes of which we have never seen. And I suspect that we are not prepared. The question is, what information can we retrieve that will land a killing blow before it begins?"

"It's going to be the Planet Drinkers isn't it? We are going to have to neutralize them. If we have our Drinkers and they don't have theirs, we can easily turn back their armies when the planets are in phase."

Something about this just seemed sad to Emlyn. The Drinkers didn't ask for any of this, they just happened to be born on the wrong side of the world, and for some reason that meant that they would have to be killed.

"If you are feeling some kind of loyalty to the Drinker of Kris, don't" Orin said. "I understand the feeling, you both share a bond. But what about all those soldiers who are going to die on the battlefields? They are just as much human as you are, but they too are going to die because they follow the wrong King."

Emlyn saw the logic behind Orin's words, but it didn't change how she felt. She did feel a connection, to all the Planet Drinkers. There was something that most people couldn't understand. There was a pain to being born a weapon, a possession of the state. Most people could make choices; they could live their own lives. She never could.

"I will do my duty. We will do our duty" she said, with a tone somewhere between determination and resignation.

"You are young, one day you will understand the sacrifices that need to be made for the greater good" Orin said quietly, but he didn't quite meet her eyes.

They spent the day going through the documents, Orin making notes about his suspicions and discussing his thoughts with Emlyn. Emlyn wondered to himself where whether such rampant speculation actually produced any actionable evidence. Indeed, it seemed to Emlyn, all one would have to do to ensure that your enemy surrendered immediately was to write down that you had ordered one million uniforms for your army and ensure that their spies received a copy.

But there was definitely a method to his madness, and by the time it was the fourth bell after lunch, Orin had drawn conclusions that Emlyn could not deny. Orin sat back and started on his pipe again, carefully compacting the leaf into the bowl, lighting it and pulling on the smoke smoothly.

"The question now, is what further information can we glean, now that have the first clue", Orin said thoughtfully. "The data that we have now, is strategically valuable, plenty here about troop numbers and deployment location. But most of that will be provided by our eyes and ears in the field. One can only move a body of men so quickly, we will have that information in time to act on it no matter what. No, we need to provide The House with something further, something truly shattering".

Orin went off into yet another one of his trances, and Emlyn figured it was best to give him some time. She pulled out her book once again, pulled both of her feet onto the chair so that she sat in a crouched position, and started to read.

There was something about history. It brought about a certain feeling of inevitability in her. When most people read a history book, they would think about all the things that once happened long ago. When Emlyn read a history book, she thought about all the things that were going to happen again in the future.

I mean, when you consider that Verris and Kris have been to war three times in the last two hundred years, how could we not be due another one after three hundred years of peace? Of course, if her mathematics tutor knew what she was thinking would have given her a very stern talking to about prior results affecting future events, but then again, Emlyn thought that Mathematicians didn't really understand the real world.

No, this was bound to happen. And with the planets in the positions they were in now, Verris was very exposed. Legudis, the planet of the people of Kris, was coming into its most powerful phase in over a century. It provided the Planet Drinkers of Kris with unlimited agility.

Many people thought Emlyn was fast. When she kicked or punched, they swore that she simply moved her limbs from one place to the other without going through the space between. Yet, this paled in comparison to the recordings of the Planet Drinkers of Legudis. One Legudis Drinker could slit the throat of a hundred men, before one of them to could draw his blade. What good was her strength, if her enemy simply sliced her throat the second she saw them?

And if that wasn't bad enough, Meranis was going out of phase, and would not be at its strongest again for more than two years. An attack now would be deadly. There had to be something they could do, some way to reverse the oncoming apocalypse. 

More Stuff here

...

Chapter Goes here.

Okay, so basically it is like this. Orin notices something. Seems like there is a huge amount of gold and steel going to the Royal Mint. But thing is, there never seems to be any coins coming out. What's up with that. Orin has a theory, but he will have to confirm.

11.
---

Under the cover of night Emlyn and Orin made their way through the fog filled streets, not quite skulking, but clearly not wanting to be seen either. 
Meranis was in perfect conjunction, directly above their heads, where the power flowed directly through her like a torrent, made all the worse by knowing that it would be slowly shrinking over the horizon as the night gave way to morning.

"Allright, let's go, Orin whispered, pointing up at the top of the tall wall surrounding the Treasury. Standing two feet away from the wall, Emlyn bent down and cupped her hands together, giving a stand for Orin to place his right foot in.

"Ready?", Emlyn asked. Orin swallowed grimly, eyes closed in silent prayer to the god's he didn't believe in before he opened them and gave a short nod.

Emlyn tapped the power of Meranis, opening herself up to the power of Meranis, allowing the the unspeakable euphoria to overtake her momentarily. She gave a massive heave with her arms and sent Orin whistling into the air. Her breath caught in her throat as she saw Orin reach his peak and begin to fall, before he landed noiselessly on the top of the wall and she began to breath again.

Soaring through the air, she glided gracefully onto the wall, landing lightly on of the crenelations and giving a little bow to Orin.

"Okay, well, then onwards we go" Emlyn replied, as Orin started to unwind the rope that he had wound around his stomach, which had anchored him to Emlyn in flight.

Orin took the rope and tied one end around the crenelation before offering the other end to Emlyn. Took the other end, wrapped it twice around her hand, and then leapt into the night.

She flew through the air lightly, perfectly pitched to carry her gracefully onto the inner keep of the Treasury.The roof rose up to meet her and she landed lightly on the copper tiles.

She let herself slip down the sloped roof until till she reached the edge and she leant her back against one of the stone gargoyles. She took her rope, pulled it taught and began to tie it firmly around the stone gargoyle. 

After checking and rechecking her knots in the dim nightlight, she gave three tugs on the taught rope and felt three tugs come back from Orin. Letting go, she rested against the Gargoyle until twenty seconds later Orin came looming out the darkness, striding arrogantly across the rope.

As he came to the top of the roof, Emlyn stretched out her hand and pulled Orin to safety.

"Excellent, now to find an entrance"

Tying another rope around the Gargoyle, Orin started to repel down the side of the building. After a brief scuffle with one of the windows, the shutter popped open and he swung inside. Emlyn waited ten seconds, before wrapping on of her legs around the rope and following.

In the dim light of the room, Emlyn looked around to survey it's contents. It seemed like some abandoned storage coset. Judging by the thick layer of dust in this room, no one had been here in quite a while. Years, perhaps decades, had come and gone, and no doubt those who had once known what was supposed to be held within had moved on, taking their secrets with them.

Endless reams of paper, ledgers and books stood in endless stacks, filling the room from wall to wall, just enoguh space remaining to walk narrowly between them to retrieve any old document. If there was any kind of system, it was a mystery to Emlyn. The faded writing gave no clue as to what their contents contained.

"Want to give this one a go?" Orin whispered, inviting Emlyn to unlock the door that would allow them access to the corridor that would take them to their objective.

Emlyn knelt down beside the door and slipped her toolset out of her bag. Peering at the lock she started to gently riggle the long metal implements, encouraging the lock to open.

There waws something very satisfying about opening locks. The finesse of it, knowing just how much pressure to use, and where. Too little and lock would not turn, too much and the lock would jam and you would have to start from the beginning again. Not much different from people really. Just a study in pressure and patience. Compliance was just a matter of time.

But this lock would not comply. Everytime she thought she was near, something odd would occur and she would be forced to start from the beginning again. And Orin's sigh's from behind weren't helping.

She tried every trick she knew, but everytime she got a little bit closer, she found something that would just not give way. Finally Orin put his hand on her shoulder and she withdrew her tools and stood back to let Orin try his luck. Although, Orin would of course say that it would only take pure skill when he did it.

While Orin drew his own set of finely crafted lock picks from his belt Emlyn wandered the room. Orin swore that he had won the lock picks from a giant in a wrestling match, or was it the present for rescuing a nobleman's wife from a band of raiding savages? There was definitely tall story behind how he came into a set of lock picks inlaid with pearl and gold. Although he no doubt stole them from some unfortunate mark or other. Irony was never lost on Orin, and he no doubt took great glee in stealing from a would be thief.

Emlyn found herself looking at the ledgers and books that stood in their towering stacks in the room. Most were the typical boring sort, reports of one lord's complaint against the other. Taxes too high, too many raiders attacking the merchant fleets, one nobleman's daughter seduced another's son and was now trying to get him to name the bastard as his heir.

Most of the reports were written in the common tounge, painstakenly copied out in smooth clear script, quill and ink engraved with expert precision. Others were written in some kind of cypher, their keys included on a loose paper between the cover and the first page. Being consigned to this room was the only action needed to ensure that they would never be read again.

The lock clicked and Orin peaked through the crack in the door.

"All clear", Orin informed her. "That lock was a real nightmare, was just about ready to ask you to smash through near the end there."

"Seems like someone predicted someone might try to do what we did", Emlyn replied, concern in her voice.

"Hardly. More likely no one ever wanted those documents read. No doubt one hundred years ago those secrets would have been most valuable. The grave has taken the men and this room has taken their secrets. Lets be on our way. Remain silent."

They snuck out into the corridor and Orin leapt off into the darkness, Emlyn following on fleet footsteps behind him. There is a trade off between speed and silence, and Orin rides the knife edge, skating along the dark stone corridors, never making more than the faintest of footsteps. 

Emlyn felt like a lumbering beast, as her quiet steps, sending thundering echoes off the bare stone walls in the labyrinthine tunnels inside the Mint.

Orin put his ear to a heavy wooden door before pulling it wide to find a winding staircase leading to the murky depths of the levels below. He turned around, winked in the dim light of the corridor and flew through the door, Emlyn following just steps behind him.

Emlyn regretted closing the door immediately, as the suffocating darkness enveloped them. Emlyn stuck her left arm to the wall while her right groped into the still air in front of her. She found Orin, their arms wrapping clumsily around each other in the pitch blackness.  Orin slipped his arm down hers until he had Emlyn's hand in his. He gave a brief squeeze of support and pulled her as he headed down the lightless stairs.

Emlyn held on tight, rushing headlong into the hellish depths, certain each step would be her last. They dashed step after step, leaving their secret entrance miles above them. Emlyn thought about the long journey that still lay ahead of her, having to travel back up the steps to make good their escape.

Finally Orin, slowed to a stop and after a brief pause said "Do you hear that?". 

Emlyn held here breath and in the deep silence, heard a faint metalic sound. Mechanical. A crashing and crunching of too many moving parts.

"The mint?" she asked, her voice bouncing off the walls in the darkness.

"Indeed" Orin replied, "Now we will what is going on here." 

Orin swung the door open slowly and quietly as the small light of the mounted torches struck their tender eyes.

"Lets go", Orin said, releasing her hand and slipping into the corridor. Emlyn followed.

12.
---

Drawn onwawrd by the ever increasing volume of the grinding machinery, they dashed through the passages in the Royal Mint. Emlyn was totally lost now. She wondered how Orin was able to keep himself oriented, trying to shut out the terrible thought that maybe he didn't.

Emlyn wasn't even really sure they were above ground anymore. They had traveled so long and so far that she wouldn't be surprised if she was in a different country entirely.

Orin waved her to a stop, and she leant against wall, trying to blend in with the shadows. Orin was leant against wall at an intersection. He poked his head out and snapped it back and fixed his gaze on Emlyn.

Two guards. Twenty yards down the corridor. Armed. Orin signed all the information she would need in a series of sharp, precise hand motions. Emlyn nodded.

Approaching a corner, Emlyn dropped into the shadow of the wall and stuck her head out to check the adjacent corridor. 

She slipped down the corridor, lump in her throat, skin tingling with excitement and pounding terror. 

Clad in bright blue uniforms with embroidered silver lining and fine swords by their sides, they appeared stood to attention beside a non-descript door. Had they not been there, she may have missed the room entirely, Emlyn thought to herself. But their presence gave away the prizes within. 

Stepping out, she took on her guise of the damsel in distress. If there was one thing all military men loved, it was having helping out an woman in need. Why, who wouldn't be thankful? And who knows how thankful she might be?

"Woah, stop right there!" the first guard yelled, stretching out his hand. "What are you doing down here?" asked the younger guard, in a friendlier tone.

"Thank goodness" Emlyn replied, putting on her most earnest voice. "I got lost, I have been wandering around for ages!"

"STOP! Not one more step, or I'll run you through!" the senior guard shouted again, putting his right hand to the hilt of his sword, as he pulled the sheath clear of his cloak with military precision. Still, the die was cast and it would take far more than two guards to dissuade her from carrying out her mission.

"Sorry", she said, almost crying, "I was just so scared".

"That's okay, but please stand right there, I'll get one of my colleagues will assist you", the guard replied, and moved his hand to put his whistle to his lips. 

She wasn't going to let him get off a summoning call, and by the time he knew to signal an alarm it would be too late.  This far below the Keep, she could feel only the tiniest shine of power from Meranis, but she had a phylactery with her that she had been charging all day. She triggered it with a tap and immediately felt the invisible glow burning on her skin. Drawing the power of Meranis into her chest, she darted forward with inhuman speed and punched straight for gut.

Winded, the soldier doubled over, trying to draw his sword, but it was too late. She whipped her knee up and felt a dull thud as her knee made contact with his head.

The impact was glancing and her fingers screamed for the wall, begging for purchase as she tried to steady herself. Her skin went icily cold and sweat burst out on her skin, her fear of death manifesting suddenly as she straightened back up to see the first guard slumped unconsciously on the floor, the younger guard staring down at him in shock. As he locked eyes with her he started backing away, his shaking hand going for his sword as well.

Emlyn almost felt sorry for him. Simply the wrong man in the wrong place at the wrong time. If he had been born in Verris he might have been someone she could have become friends with, perhaps one of the scribes or valet or any of the other young men that she would talk to in the Royal Gardens back home. She almost felt sorry for him.

She swung again, this time her left fist landing a solid contact on his forehead, his head whipping back violently into wall behind him. As he slid down the wall to join his fellow slumberer on floor, Emlyn turned, checking the corridor both ways, fearing the sound of charging guards coming to assist their friends. 

But no one came. As the adrenaline started leaving her body, her body started to shake and she crouched down taking deep breaths trying to regain her composure. With the adrenaline, the power that had been infused in her body started to fade and she started to feel her body start to ache. While, Meranis provided you with strength and alacrity, it wouldn't stop you from paying the price for your actions. She would feel the pain come tomorrow, but it could be worse, she could have been one of the soldiers.

"Nicely done. A little scrappy, but not too bad I think." Orin said, walking up to her. Emlyn just crouched, looking up at him, trying to catch her breath.

"So, we have come a long way. Shall we see what our efforts have bought us?" and Orin swung the door open.

12.
---

They entered what had once been a cavernous gallery with wooden panellig on the walls and floors betraying its once majestic designs. It had clearly once been a room once used for entertaining elegant heads of state on a tour of where their money was kept.

It had now been repurposed, the fine furniture pushed to the edges of the room, the once beautiful thick carpet sat roled up in the one of the corners.

Their eyes were drawn to the what now dominated the room. A single large metal contraption sat squarely in the middle of the room, surrounded by stacks of paper on half a dozen desks.

Approaching the desks, Orin picked up the papers and inspected them.

"Well, this trip has not been a waste." he said, passing one of the sheets to Emlyn.

"Promissory Notes?" Emlyn asked.

"Yes, specifically, Verrisian Promissory Notes. No doubt, Kris would like to use our own money to wage war against us. They cash these in, take our money and inflate our own economy at the same time. Perfect forgeries. The perfect crime".

"Perfect? When did you become an expert on forgery?"

"Well, they look real to me, and I assume that they wouldn't bother making them if they were anything less than perfect. While there are some people who will accept Promissory Notes as payment, with a quantity this big, they will need to turn most of these into one of our Royal Banks. If they can't fool the Banks, these will be worthless."

They walked around the room, inspecting the different notes, boxes of supplies and the copious amount of handwritten notes that were dashed around the place. Orin pulled up a chair at one of the desks and started reading."

"We're in trouble"

"Oh?"

"Well, judging from the amount of notes we have stacked here", he said indicating the promissory notes stood on the desks, " and the amounts they are refering to in these notes, there is a significant amount missing. The notes from the quartermaster indicated that about ten times as much paper has been delivered here and these notes concur. Some may have been lost to waste, ten or twenty percent maybe, but there should still be plenty stacked here."

"Well ther is no way we can really know how much has been received. They could have received paper from plenty of sources not on the manifest".

"Unlikely. Only a very specific type of paper can be used for Promissory Notes, and they are not sold on every market corner. No, I think that a large amount of notes have been produced and shipped out from here already."

Orin closed the ledger that he had been reading and stuck it into his bag along to join the stolen notes.

"Okay, this isn't really our job, but seeing as we are here and knocking out those guards has already given us away, Let us commit a little sabotage. And then lets go. This is enough evidence to indicate that Kris is almost certainly going to got to war with us"

Orin folded a few of the sheets and stuck them in his bag and then walked over to the giant metal contraption and started inspecting it. He bent over, looking at all it's different angles, before going back to one of the desks and picking up one fo the tools tha was neatly laid on it.

Going back to the machine, he took the tool and gave the tool a swift tap somewhere inside the machine before once more re-emerging.

"What was that?" Emyln asked?

"I made  a small mark on the stamp. Probably too small for anyone to notice it if they weren't looking for it, but should allow us to spot any more forgeries in the future."

"By the way, how did you know that the forgeries were being made on this floor?"

"Well", Orin started, "I heard... the machine".

"But its not in use at the moment, so what was it that you heard?"

"We need to go", Orin said and started to walk swiftly towards the door magnificent oak door before stopping dead  as it swung open violently. Two dozen soldiers, filed in spreading out along the wall in perfect formation, each with their hands on their swords, a look of steely determination in their eyes.

As the pair came through the door and stood on either side, a final man came through, a look of calm confidence and superiority on his face. Judgin from the insignia Emlyn put him down as the the Captain of the guard, the highest member of the Royal Body Guard. Emlynjudged him too be well into his sixties, he face aged and weathered, scarred and marked and his a hair a shock of grey, still plenty left, but clear sings of balding. 

But there was no mistaking his lethal physique. This man could take on half a dozen men half his age without breaking a sweat. And as he locked his eyes with Emlyn, she felt a icy hand of fear on her heart, freezing her in place.

"Well, well. Don't you too looked lost." The Captain said, his smile growing over his face. "So very far from home, and in the company of strangers. I don't suppose there is any chance of you coming with us without resorting to violence?"

Silence filled the room. Emlyn stared down The Captain and waited, heart hammerign in her chest, a thousand thoughts going through her mind. The fear was now starting to take her. It suddenly occured to Emlyn that she had never been truly afraid before. She had never truly confronted the thought of her own mortality, before this very second. That was a bit of an oversight really, surely some of her trainign should have dealt with her having to accept that she would one have to die. Now was really not a great time to have to come to terms with such things. 

"Rosie?" Orin said, breaking her out of her hypnosis. Cool as always, Orin stared directly ahead, never taking his eyes off the captain.

"Yeah?", she acknowledged breathlessly, the short word taking all of her will to speak, while her panic started to crash down on her like an enornomous wave in a sea of fear.

"Run".

13.
---

Orin turned on his heels and ran full tilt towards one of the doors on the other side of the room. 

"Draw swords!" The Captain shouted, and the Regiment moved in one smooth motion to bring their arms to bear.

Emlyn came out of her trance and charged after Orin, heading towards the rear wall. She could hear the men chargin after her, their heavy combat boots thundering on the floor. The sound of a loosed crossbow bolt rang through the room and Emlyn dived behind the printing press as the fletching skimmed past her cheek.

Her back to the press, she could see that Orin had almost reached door, and she knew there was no way that she could catch up with him before the soldiers were on her.

Tapping her Planet Well once more, she drew Merais into her once more, the power flowing from her necklace into her very soul. She crouched down, bracing her feet on the floor and she grabbed giant contraption in her hands.

With an enormous, wrenching determination Emlyn began to lift the press over herself. Slowly the press started to lift off the floor and into the air, the metal coffin hanging perilously over her.

Fighting it, inch by inch, she moved it into position, directly above her and she twisted violently tossing the press press directly at The Captain as she felt Miranis leave her, the Planet Well finally having run dry.

The framework flew through the air and careened over the elegant hall as Emlyn's feet went out from under her, the force of throwing the press tossing her in the direction. Airborn, she felt herself hurtling towards Orin, she grinned as she saw the look of disbelief of the soldiers faces.

The contraption thundered into the floor, a deafening crash bursting through the room. Emlyn could see soldiers, flung into the air as the press careened across the room, sliding at high speed towards the main doors leaving inch deep gouges into the beautfifully laid timbers.

Emlyn passed through open door, still airborn, and flew past Orin as she fianlly hit the floor, rolling over backwards, the world rotating in front of her eyes, before she found her feet, still sliding backwards from her momentum.

"Nice", Orin said, breathlessly as he continued through the immaculate state room towards the next door, Emlyn hot on his heels.

"We gotta get outside" Emlyn gasped "My Planet Well is dry."

"Third floor" Orin replied, "Down" he indicated.

Whipping her head aroud, Emlyn saw half a dozen soldiers chasing after them, swords drawn, one room behind. "Go!" she shouted.

The dashed through room after room in one long gallery, each room beautifully decorated, hanging art on the walls, exquisite chandleries lighting the rooms. Door after door they charged through, the soldiers following hot on their heels.

Emlyn's legs ached, her lngs were on fire and she felt as though her heart was about burst. They were hardly even running any more, stuck somewhere between jogging and walking fast, their breathing heavy as they tried to keep ahead of their persuers, who were in the same state.

Looking wildly for a window or a staircase they kept on limping forward. How big is this building Emlyn asked herself, there is no way they couldn't be out yet.

And just then Orin dashed through the next room and came out to a broad stone staircase leading down to the atrium at the front of the Mint. Giant stone statues stood in the atrium, men riding tigers and snakes locked in combat. And between, them stood another dozen soldiers, guarding the exit.

Emlyn could feel the whispers of Meranis through the giant plate windows, but they must have been facing south, as she could not pull on her power. She needed to get outside, but would be sliced to pieces before she got to the door. Which is almost certainly locked, she thought.

"What now?" Emlyn asked, her panic once again rising, the adrenaline starting to grip her body in spasms. The guards in front of the them drew their swords and started to advance, and Emlyn heard the guards behind them catching up.

"You catch me" Orin replied, and pointing to Emlyn's right along the walkway he whispered "The window".

Without thinking Emlyn sprinted towards the window, her body once again in agony, she willed her body to give it everything she had and burst through the glass. She raised her arms to take protect her face, and felt the glass slice at her, agony gripping her forearms as she dived into the cool night air.

Suddenly she felt Meranis' Power and drew on it once more. Ecstasy filled her, her pain disappearing into the abyss of euphoria that the Power covered her in. 

The ground rushed to her and she rolled to get her feet under her as she thundered into the ground, the air being pushed out of her lungs by her collision with the courtyard. Emlyn rolled to lessen the impact and looked up at the window she had just dived through to see Orin's siloutte diving through the window, his legs flailing in the air as two crossbow bolts flew out the window over his head.

Emlyn ran towards him and tried to predict where he would fall. As Orin careened through the night Emlyn braced herself once again for impact. as Orin pinwheeled downward Emlyn threw her arms open and caught him around the chest as he flew towards the hard stone.

The impact hit her like a chargin cavalry horse, as she was once again knoecked off her feet, careenning over the dull paving stones gripping Orin tightly as she could. As the world rotated around her she could hear the front doors of The Mint open and the soldiers poured out into the courtyard to try and surround them.

"Okay?" Emlyn asked as she disentangled herself from Orin, who gave a short nod, a graven look on his face.

"Time to fly again" she said, and bent down to give him another boost over the walls. Shaking, he placed his foot in her hands and she sent him flying into the air and onto the wall.

The soldiers charged at her, inhuman words, growls and screams spilling from their mouths. Their swords caught brilliant reflections of the moon in their polished steel. And Emlyn saw the hate in their eyes.

She bent down into a crouch and kicked off violently, evading their swords and rocketing to the top of the wall. Too much. She knew it immediately, she had used to much power, she would go sailing right over the wall. 

Time seemed to slow to a crawl, she saw the wall flying past her face, before it gave way to crenelations and then nothing but air. As she reached the peak of her jump, she looked down saw the concrete courtyard below, the soldiers all staring up at her, disbelieving. 

Under any normal circumstances she would be fine, well she would live, if she could just land on her feet in the street, but after all that she had been through tonight, she wasn't so sure anymore.

Suddenly a rope shot past her face, and she instinctively, grabbed at it and pulled.

Emlyn felt herself, getting pulled in towards the wall, when suddenly she saw Orin shooting towards her, pulled bodily off his feet by the strength of the her pull. Without thinking, she curled into a tight ball and felt Orin shoot over her head, the two of them in some kind of bizarre airborne dance, Emlyn open herself up for the landing and made a firm landing on the top of the wall, her feet looking for purchase on the dry stone.

Orin. It was a single thought, violent and urgent. His brief flight brought by pulling his rope was coming to an end he began once again to fall. Emlyn, coiled the rope in around her with a panicked urgency.

The rope became taught with about ten feet between her and orin as he went hurtling past her, in a determined silence from a man who had every reason to be screaming at the top of his lungs.

The pressure on the rope suddenly increased like the kick of a bull, the roped snapped taught, Shocking Emlyn's body, causing her to grit her teeth, as she took Orin's full weight. Planet Drinker or not, she still had the same weight, and Orin was far heavier than her. Momentum was not in her favour here.

Everything went quiet and Emlyn held her breath, straining against the rope. She looked both ways along the wall, expecting guards to come running, surely they had made too much noise.

But when no one came, Emlyn started to pull on the rope and inch by inch she lifted Orin back up, until finally his arm came over the side of the wall and he rolled over and they both collapsed onto the cold hard stone.

The charge of footsteps cam ethundering over the walls as guards closed on their position and Emlyn and Orin picked up their tired bodies and pushed themselves to the limit.

"Get the rope", Orin yelled throwing her a spare coil, and Emlyn started tying it around the crenellations, while Orin projected his throwing knives into the darkness, where Emlyn could hear the screams indicating they had made contact.

"Done", Emln yelled as she threw herself over the wall and started to bounce down the wall to the bottom. Looking up, she saw Orin swing over the wall as well and they both dropped to the  street outside.

As they dissapeared into a dark alley, Emlyn heard the front gate open and the cries of soldiers in the night. They limped through the alleys, changing direction at random until they came out at another main road.

And then Emlyn heard the bark of the hounds.

"Noo..." Emlyn moaned, as Orin grabbed her arm and pulled her onward.

14.
---

Orin threw his last knife and the dog went scittering to the ground, a yelp of pain escaping its throat. "I'm out" Orin gasped.

"Me too" Emlyn whimpered. "And I don't have the strength for another fight. I am drawing on Meranis just to walk. If I lose her again, I am going to collapse."

"Just keep going" Orin coaxed. "We are almost out. Go"

They limped onwards, through the maze of dingy streets and dark alleys. Everything hurt, Emlyn was in complete agony. Just moving one leg in front of the other took a monumental force of will. 

Emlyn could smell the ocean. They must be near the port, the salty air called for freedom, they were far away from their persuers now. With the final dog slain, surely there was no way that anyone could find them now.

"Dead end" Orin whispered, turning his back on the brick wall forbidding their way at the end of the narrow passage.  Emlyn turned and spotted the dark siloutte looming at the mouth of the road, blocking their way.

A whistle rang clear in the night sky and The Captain walked into the light, summoning his beleagured troops to assist him.

"Go Rosie. To the roof. I will meet you at the home."

"What?" Emlyn asked.

"Trust me. I can handle them, but you have to go. Now! GO!" Orin yelled. 

Emlyn turned and knelt, and kicked off. She stared down as she once again took to the air. Orin was looking up at her, and she felt as sense of doom overcoming her.

The fatigue wracked her body as she fell to the roof. Forcing herself back to her feet, she stared into the alley below and watched as Orin began to fight his way to safety.

Except, he didn't. Orin was knealt down, hands on his knees in sumbission, while The Captain approached him with two soldiers flanking him.

"A Planet Drinker? Not something a man such as I gets to see everyday." I am going to enjoy tracking her down."

Orin sat, completely passive, staring The Captain down. Emlyn could see that his breath was calm, face composed, resigned to his fate.

"Not going to run anymore? Not gonna fight?"

Emlyn froze. She had never thoughth that this would happen. Orin would allow himself to get captured, requiring that he be taken to a holding cell in some dark corner of the city dungeons.

Orin knew too much to be captured. He had probably already taken the poison which would be coursing through his veins. He would be able to distract them just enough to allow her to get away, but he would pass away during the night.

And Emlyn knew what she should do and what she must do. 
Emlyn dived. 

Putting the last of her strength into one big leap, she soared down back to the street, locking onto The Captain.

"There!", The Captain screamed, pointing into at her. She heard the bolt loose from the shadows as a soldier brought his arsenal to bear.

Emlyn felt a searing white heat engulf her and she felt herself tumble through the air and she crumpled onto the cold paving stones and in a blinding light she fell unconcious.

+++

As Emlyn jumped away Orin knelt down and prepared his last hope. He pulled a dark cardboard cyclinder from his pouch and rubbed it vicously on the ground.

He felt the pyromancer's trick ignite and threw it out into the night and tucked his head into his chest and squeezed eyes tightly.

"There!", a cry went out from the Captain and his heart started pounding, his fear rising, every second expecting a sword to his chest or neck.

Suddenly her head Emlyn cry out, her voice reverberating off the narrow alley walls, followed by a bone crunching thud as something thundered into the hard stone.

Orin's heart quavered, but he held his eyes tightly shut and counted each of his heart beats, preparing for what was about to come. 

A white hot heat washed over him, and he heard the screams of the guards and the unsteady footsteps and metal clanging on the street as the guards wheeled backwards falling over their own feet.

He rose to his feet and charged towards The Captain, who stood, dazed, with his sword held two handed in a defensive stance. Emlyn lay on the ground at his feet. A pool of blood was starting to form around her head.

Orin's hand went to his belt, but he had used his last knife and all his other weapons would bring him too close to The Captains broadsword's lethal range.

Plan B. Orin darted forward and took a long kick at The Captain's stomach, who keeled over, his sword drooping low.

Orin stepped back and straightened up to deal sharp kick to the side of The Captain's head. At least he tried, but his kick went too low and caught The Captain on the shoulder, sending them booth reeling.

Orin felt his age, a heavy weight pressing down on his body, a thick miasma of quicksand slowing down his every movement. Ten years ago he could have run a hundred leagues and dealt 100 such kicks with pinpoint precision.

But he simply wasn't the man he used to be. Smarter and wiser, definitely, but he simply couldn't do what he once had.

There was no time to think of that now. He wheeled wildly, found his footing and dived once again at The Captain,  knocking them both to the ground. 

The Captain's tried to bring his sword to bear, but Orin pushed his arm aside and, using both his hands, dashed The Captain's fist against the hard ground sending scattering his sword out of reach.

But The Captain rolled with the attack and threw blind punch into Orin's side, winding and dislodging Orin from his dominant position.

Orin rolled away and came to his feet, while his leaden lungs heaved trying to suck in the cool night air. Doubt clouded Orin's mind as he prepared for the next bout.

Suddenly The Captain's eyes cleared, and locking eyes on his sword he leapt to his feet. Orin's heart hammered in his chest and he dashed to intercept just as The Captain caught his foot on loose paving stone and stumbled to his knees, mere inches away from the sword's hilt.

Taking his second chance, Orin whipped his leg up violently and this time he made good contact and The Captain went limp as his chin met Orin's foot.

Orin looked upon the makeshift battlefield and saw three young soldiers, staring blindly out into the dark night. They clearly hadn't been able to look away and had a full blast of his flash paper.

Within a split second Orin had disregarded them and he dived to Emlyn's side, his heart in his throat, praying silently once again. Perhaps he should have been a priest he thought rhyley.

"Emlyn? Emlyn?" he whispered frantically in her ear, more loudly than was wise, but he didn't think anyone heard him. She didn't move. Orin placed his ear ove her mouth and heard her shallow breathing and his heart started again.

Orin dove his arm's under her and pulled her too his chest. She was so small, barely a weight at all. He often forgot just how fragile she was. She hid behind the mask of her incredible gift and it was difficult for anyone who knew her not to find her incredibly intimidating.

But the reality was that she was barely more than a child. In another life she would still be running around with ribbons in her hair, hoping that she would marry a prince and talking about her dream wedding with her friends.
 
And now she could be inches from death. Orin rose to his feet, supporting her head in the crook of his left arm and letting her legs dangle from his right. Her hair was drenched in blood which dripped wetly to the ground, splattering into the large pool which had already formed.
 
Orin ran. Faster than he ever had before. Emlyn's white face lolled, her eyes wide open in the pale moonlight, staring blankly at the stars above. 
 
He reached reached the bay and after stopping to ensure that Emlyn had stopped bleeding, lest he give away their path, he continued on to their Inn.
 
Emlyn now felt like a sack of bricks in his grip and his arm's ached, but he ran on and on, until, at last, the inn was in sight.
 
He hammered on the door, and an eternity passed before the door gave cracked open and he charged through.
 
"We were beset by footpads" he gasped to the startled landlady. "Please, you must get the doctor".

"There's no doctors near here, sir. And there is no way I am venturing out into the night with footpads a'prowling".

"Just get out of my way then" he said, staring at her darkly.

"Don't get me wrong, I want to help, but me getting hurt won't her out any" she replied.

"I'm sorry" Orin said, looking down for a second. "Thank you, have a good night" he said and  charged up the stairs to their room on the third floor  leaving the landlady looking up at him disbelievingly.

Orin fumbled with the lock Orin and fell into the room with Emlyn in his arms.

Using one last burst of strength he heaved her onto the desk and sank into one of the chairs, head in his hands. How had it all gone so wrong? He had done everything right, every precaution taken. Shouldn't he have even tried to go to the Mint? He was pretty sure of what was happening, but he had to confirm didn't he?

No time to think about that now, Emlyn's life still hung in the balance. Rising to his feet he put his fingers to her neck. A pulse. She had lost a lot of blood, but not too much and life still coursed through her.

His relief was intense, but he knew there were still danger. Even tiny cuts could be fatal if they became infect and this was way more than a tiny cut.

He grabbed the wash basin, placed it below her head and started to wash her wound, her long brown hanging into the basin. The water ws soon filled with blood and Orin started to treat the wound with herbs and bandage.

Finally Orin had to accept that there was nothing else that he could do and rested for a minute before carrying her to her room. He laid her on the bed and stripped her of her sweat soaked and bloodstain clothes before tucking her beneath the covers.

And finally, after a lifetime had passed, Orin fell into a Emlyn's chair and fell into a fitful slumber.

15.
---

Emlyn woke to pain and darkness. Her whole body ached, and she felt beyond nauseous. She rolled over and she felt her hair matted to the blood soaked pillow.

So, she had made it back to the inn. It occurred to her that she was lucky to have woken up at all. She could just as easily have not. The number of times she could just as easily have died... Best not to think about it.

She tried to call out for Orin. But her mouth wouldn't move. Just opening her mouth was too painful. She groaned quietly, but didn't move.

But if she had saved Orin's life, it had all been worth it. That he had been ready to give his life to save hers... Well she guessed she always knew that he would. Orin was like a father too her. She always knew, deep down, that he would lay down his life for her. And now he had.

Emlyn found herself starting to cry. And as the tears streamed down her face, her chest convulsed in sobs and the spasms wracked her with more pain.

The thought of losing Orin was more than she could bear. The weight of how close it had been fell on her and it was more than she could stand. 

Orin meant everything to her. Her anger burned at the thought that he would sacrifice himself to save her. What was she supposed to do without him? Live the rest of her life in regret. Hating herself for not being strong enough to save them both.

And she loathed herself as she selfish thought about what everyone else would think. How could a Planet Drinker let her partner die, why had she been there if not to support her superior?

She would have been released from the House, asked to spend the rest of her life as a military weapon, training as a simple brute, a killing machine. Too kind a penance for her complete incompetence.

Her thoughts darkened and she slipped back into unconciousness. She drifted in out throuhout the night, her pain being the only way she could tell when she was lucid. 

When she awoke a gain, the sun was already high int he sky and she felt Orin's hand on her forehead.

"No fever", he whispered as her eyes flickered open momentarily before she squeezed them tight against the blinding light shining through the window. Straining, she moved one of her hands from under the covers and reached out for Orin limply. He caught her hand and she entwined her fingers in his. His hand felt intensely hot.

"You have lost a lot of blood. You are very cold. But I don't think that you have an infection" he whispered. She squeezed his hand softly, and lay still.

She found herself crying again. Relief overwhelmed her, just knowing that Orin was still okay was enough to put her heart at rest. She nodded off again into a dreamless sleep, before being brought around again by Orin sitting her up against the wall.

"Time to drink", he said, placing a cup of cool water to her lips. She suddenly realized how thirsty she was and drank the water down in one long slow gulp. 

Enghhh...., new StoryLine...

As they crested the hill Jake sighed with happiness. "Ahhh, there's no place like home is there Marc?".
"Indeed", Marcus replied.
Rens lay before them, the capital city of Kris shining like a jewel before the sparkling blue Ferudian Sea. They weren't close enough to smell it yet.
"You can have some time to see your family Jake", Marcus said. "It is four hours to sundown and there won't be much time to do anything today."

Jake leant back in his saddle, flexing his stiff fingers in front of him thinking of his young wife and two children.

"But I will be will be fetching you at the crack of dawn tomorrow. If there truly is a Drinker in The Capital it is vital that we eliminate the threat as quickly as possible."

"Yes sir", the young officer replied, unconsciously willing his horse into a trot in his eagerness to make the most of today.

"Then would you like to have dinner with me tonight sir? I am sure that Samantha would like to see you again" Jake offered politely.

Marcus laughed heartily. "You know as well as I do that Sam hates me, as I am always the one stealing you away from her", Sam said, a grin on his face. 

"Thanks for the offer Jake, it is most kind. But I think it is best that you spend as much time with your family as possible, besides, I suspect that I will have plenty to do at the Keep before the morrow."

Jake's eyebrows rose, locking his eyes with Marcus's but he knew better than to ask further. Marcus would tell him whatever he needed to know when the time was right.

As they trotted up to the Second Gate the guards, noticing the insignia on their impeccably maintained uniforms, snapped to attention and saluted. The two horseman nodded in respect and pulled up.

"What news to report Lieutenant?" 

"Little enough Colonel." the guard said. "The usual crime and villainy that the summer harvest brings, but nothing remarkable."

"Indeed, well that is good news, at ease", Marcus replied, and they trotted on through the gates.

So, the guards haven't been put on alert, Jake thought to himself. Hardly surprising, that could only spark panic and rumor. Suddenly every commoner would be swearing that their neighbours were all enemy Planet Drinkers and their would be panicked mobs and lynchings in the street. And besides, what would warning the guards accomplish? They would be extra vigilant for someone who looks completely normal and they have no way to fight? Foolishness.

No, it would have to be up to them, Jake acknowledged. If they had been brought back the Crown was clearly very concerned about the threat. A pair of Scryers like themselves were a precious commodity, and they had had to abandon their mission to return home at all speed.

They had received their orders two days ago and they had ridden hard to return to Rens. So, the attackers would have had three days to make good their escape, or go fully underground. Or accomplish their mission. 

Of course, if they had succeeded, surely the city would be alive with gossip and rumors. But no, it was just another beautiful summers days, they had made it in time.

"Alright, I am headed up to the keep, you are headed home", Marcus said pulling up his horse at one of the wide intersections.

Jake put out his hand and Marcus shook his hand. 

"Dawn tomorrow?" Jake asked. "See you then"

---

Jake plodded down the familiar streets leading to his home. Some of shop keepers gave him a cheery wave as he rode, and wished him well on his return. He thanked them, but didn't slow his horse until he was finally within site of his home.

He lived in a good part of Rens. Not the residence of the exceptionally rich, but home to shopkeepers and scribes and other welll off members of society. If his career went well and he received the promotion he deserved, he would be able to move his family to within the Royal Square, where his two girls would be able to attend the best schools and find good husbands.

But for now, he was content. He tied his horse to the post by the water trough and he took the final few steps towards his home.

Removing his hat, he stepped through the wide open door, eyes blinking, adjusting from the sun outside to the relative gloom inside. His wife Tracy looked up with a quizzical expression from where she was sat reading at the kitchen table, before launching out of her chair in a maniacal dash towards him.

"My love!" she screamed, jumping into his arms and wrapping her legs around his waist. Bracing himself he caught her, engulfing her with his arms, his hat still in hand while she found his lips with hers. He lvoed how passionate Jessica was, which only became more intense after his long excursions.

Finally after an eternity and entirely out of breath, he let her drop to the ground as his two girls peeked their heads around the corner. Kim was four years and Anna had just turned six. Her present was in his bag. 

"Daddy", they chorused and he dropped to his knee and picked them both up in his arms.

"Oh wow, you two have got really big!", he exclaimed, their laughter bubbling up and putting a huge grin on his face.

"I was told you would be getting back until tomorrow! I wanted to prepare something special!", Jessica exclaimed in mock disappointment, wringing her hand

"We rode hard, I wanted to get back to you as soon as possible." he said, pecking her on the cheek. "Seeing my girls is the only special thing that I need."

Jake placed his daughters down again and dropped into a chair at the kitchen table, opening his bag.

"Happy Birthday Anna!" he said, his eldest daughter looking up to him, an excited expression on her face. "I am sorry I wasn't here, but I got you a present!", he said, pulling a small package wrapped in brown paper from his bag and handing it to her.

"And what do we say?", Jessica admonished as Anna's fingers darted to rip open the gift. 

"Thank you Daddy!", she said, giving him a big smile before her eyes quickly darted back to the box.

Within seconds the paper had been torn assunder and both girls were crouched over the prize. And with a squeal of delight Anna held a beautiful golden brooch in her hands.

"Thak you daddy", she repeated, giving him yet another big hug, gazing at the brooch admiringly in her outstretched hand.

"Here, let me put it on for you", Jessica said, affixing the pin to Anna's dress.

"I have something else for the two of you", he said, once again tipping into his bag and this time withdrawing to matching, exquisitely worked porcelein dolls, in long flowing white dresses and carefully painted faces.

"These are all the way from the city of Nermisis, where they make the best dolls, for only the most beautiful girls to play with he said, handing one doll to each of them. "I had these specially made for each of you", he said, pointing to where each of their names were perfectly embroidered in long flowing script into the back of the dresses.

"Can you read what this says?", he asked his elder daughter.

"Anna!", she said, looking up brightly.

"And can you read what this says?" he asked Kim, but she only shook head. "Do you want to take a guess?" he asked cheerfully, but she only shook her head again, looking down. 

"It says Kimberly, so you will always know it's yours", he said leaning down and giving her a kiss on her head. "Now why don't the two of you go and play with your new dolls while I help your mother prepare dinner", he said, giving them one final hug, before they dashed into the back of the house with gleeful voices.

As their voices died away, he pulled Jessy into another passionate kiss, them both making up for lost time. Things seemed to change so quickign when he was aware. He could hardly believe how much bigger his two girls had gotten in the four months that he had been away, he feared that next time he returned after a long trip they might be married with kids of their own if they kept up this pace.

And the house looked different. Nothing was where is had been when he had left. The kitchen table had been rotated and heavy shutters and curtains which had remained drawn during winter had now be thrown open to invite the light summer breeze to give relief from the pounding heat. There were new furnishings, clearly keeping up with the latest fashions with the other mothers of the neighbourhood.

"I am so happy you are back", she said, once again breaking off their elongated embrace.

"Me too", Jake replied, as they both found their seats.

"So" she said, with a neutral expression on her face, "how long do I have you for this time."

"Ahh". He would have to be careful about how he directed this one. "Well, I am afraid that I am not technically on leave  yet. I am still going to have to be reporting to the barracks everyday."

"You finally got a City deployment?" she said, her face brightening visibly.

"In a sense, but I am afraid it is not permanent and I am not sure how long it is going to be. But for the time being I will be in Rens, and after this I will have my leave before my next deployment."

"Well, that's something. Perhaps if you are lucky, they will decide to keep you on, training the young cadets in the Keep perhaps.", Jessica said hopefully.

"Perhaps", he replied, perhaps a little too sharply. "Lets not talk about that now Jessy, there will be plenty of time later.", he said more sofltly this time. Jessica just nodded. "Dinner?" he asked rising from his chair.

And for a while, they forgot their problems and worries and talked Jessy talked about how well the girls were doing in their lessons and what a lovely dancer Anna was and Jake talked about all the beautiful places that he had seen and would one day take all of them. And all the love and hope and beauty that Jake had hidden deep down in his soul while he had been away started to come back to the surface. And by the time they sat down for their evening meal Jake was once again part of a family.

17.
---

Leaving Jake at the turn, Marcus headed up to the keep. There were many things he needed to know. Things that were too dangerous to be entrusted to the bird wing, whther encrypted or not. Scant little had been stated, but if they had been ordered to return to Rens at all speed then it could mean only one thing. And if that was the case then they were in severe peril. 

Of course The Capital was protected at all times against all possible threats. While details were hidden from even him, there were at least a dozen active Scryers guarding The King at all times. And when he was seated in Rens they guarded the entire city, patrolling the ports and gates, looking out for anything suspicous. 

For just as a Planet Drinkers could pull on power of the Planets when they were in correct conjunction, Scryers could detect any attempt to do so. Drinkers got their power by abosrbing the power from the planets they were attuned with. This power was being radiated through the cosmos at all times, but for most people, it would just travel straight through them, as if they were panes of glass.

But when a Planet Drinker was exposed to their power, they would absorb it, as though a cloud passed over sun, casting a shadow on the ground. And Scryers could feel these "shadows". It was like passing a sudden cool spot where the sun as been obscured. It took a lot of focus and practice to be able to pick up the small changes, but it soon became second nature.

A Drinker pulling on their power on the oher hand was like turning night to day. They would cast long shadows of power, that could be felt by any Skryer in the vicinity. An experienced Skryer would even claim that they could see pattern as sure as if it were a shadow cast by the sun.

But their were ways other than Skryers to detect the presence of spies. And so Marcus decided that he would make a quick detour before reporting to the Keep.Riding onto a side street where he wouldn't be recognized he found a young courier, slipped him a letter, a coin and whispered a few words and  headed for the Keep as young boy sprinted off.

It was a long ride from the Second Gate to the Royal Keep. As the security got heavier and the patrols more frequent Marcus received more salutes and welcomes. Perhaps it would have been better to enter The City under cover of night, he thought to himself. Any Drinker with access to the rumour mill would know that two Scryers had just returned to Rens now. That could be disadvantageous to them.

Still, there was nothing he could do about it now, and odd things happened every day, the he and Jake returning early was just another thing in hundreds.

Finally approaching the gates he dismounted and handed his reigns to one of the stable boys who was nearby, knowing that he would ensure that his stallion was correctly taken care of.

"Colonel Marcus Hennis, here to see the Captain of the Guard", he declared to the guards, marching forward. The soldiers stepped back, allowing him into the first courtyard, where some of the younger officers were at morning drills. 

One of the many opportunities that wealth brought was being able to buy your sons a commision at the Royal Keep where they would be one step away from power and glory. While any soldier could rise through the ranks, few ever did. There were too many advantages to giving the scarce promotions to soldiers from rich families. Debts and promises owed to you for a powerful lords son could be invaluable in time.

Marcus' feet carried him down the familiar corridors, towards office of The Captain of the Guard. At each checkpoint he was stopped, and finally outside the door was asked to give up his sword before he was finally admitted. He wouldn't need weapons to kill any of them, but you never knew with The Captain, at over sixty he was still as strong as an ox.

The doors opened at he stepped through to see The Captain sat at his desk, fixing the young Colonel with a cool gaze. Marcus walked a few steps into the room before clipping his heels together in a salute, staring straight ahead. 

"Sit", The Captain directed, waving his hand to the chair in front of his desk. Marcus relaxed his posture and sat down as the doors behind him closed with small click. Once he had sat down The Captain continued.

"There are Drinkers in City. And they are almost certainly trying to assasinate the King". Marcus' face was locked in a neutral expression, but a thousand thoughts flashed through his mind at once. Who, what, why? The Captain rummaged through his draw and pulled out a red leather folder embossed with Royal Seal of Kris.

"This is everything we know so far", The Captain said sliding folder to Marcus who promptly flipped it open.

"Meranis... hmmm..." the First Scryer mused to himself. He flipped through the pages, his frown groing as he continued. Finally, he closed the file. "Well, this does make for interesting reading."

"Yes. Well, congratualations, this is now your problem. We need you to find them and bring them in alive, assuming that they are still in Rens". The Captain started filling out some papers on his desks. His pen dashed across the page in flowing script, filling out the paperwork that kept the world turning.

"You will have access to whatever resources you think that you need", The Captain said, handing one of the papers to the Colonel and placing it's duplicate in his own folder. "But this must remain absolutely secret. I want just you and your apprentice to bring them in. No troops. Ans remember, under no circumstances must these terrorists be killed during capture. It is imperative that we capture them alive. The girl especially. I expect your plan on my desk by ninth bell tomorrow."

The Captain gave a dismissive gesture and Marcus stood up, saluted again and left by the same door.

---

He stood on the corner of a dark street watching the dispicable world slowly choke itself to death. He watched as footpads prowled the corners, the hoares plied their trade to the foul sailors and the lone rich men rode through, oblivious, in their carriages. 

Marcus awaited his contact. It was time to find out what was really going on this city. Something didn't add up. If someone truly wanted the King dead he would be dead already. No matter what kind of security you had, you could not defeat a determined Planet Drinker assasin. But why just send a single drinker? And a young inexperienced girl at that. Not that Colonel Hennis would ever underestimate a Drinker for being a girl; once you had the power of a Planet inside you, you were more animal than man.

But still, if you were attempting to kill The King, you would send a team. Four, five Planet Drinkers. A huge investment, few countries could boast that many Planet Drinkers. But to send just one Drinker and an old man made no sense. Verris was powerful, if they were truly behind this they would have got the job done. Something was wrong, and hopefully his contact would no why.

In shadows across the street a carriage pulled up. With the curtains drawn the passenger was hidden, along with his dark passenger deep inside of him. There were unspeakable delights to be had by those with power. Sick pleasures and ravenous appetites, satiated by dining upon the desperate. Marcus could hear mumbles of the footman offering good money for a few hours work, hey you might even enjoy it. She would never be seen again. A long finger pointed out at a young beggar girl, barely an adolescent, cowering behind her friends. She shook her head, backing into the wall behind her but the clink of coin could clearly be heard, and her companions jostled her pushing her forward, towards her certain doom. She started to shake, but there would be no point crying now, no one would listen. 

Marcus felt his anger build in him. Not just at the injustice that she was being subjected to, but at his complete powerlessness to do anything. Even if he could save this one, the rich were too powerful. All it would take is the right word in the right ear and before long he would be congratulated on a job well done and given a commision in a quiet part of the world, far from politics or war, a place where he could be swept under the rug and forgotten. 

She took her last free steps and entered the hearse. The door slammed behind her and with a crack of reins the carriage departed and the beggar children squeeled with delight over their blood money.

"So, you're still alive? Seems like I owe somebody some money". 

"So it would seem, Loron", Marcus replied, his face turning in a smile to the man who had just leant on the wall next to him. "Although, at this point it might be easier for you to keep a list of the people you don't owe money to", he continued.

"Hey, no using real names at clandestine meetings, Tobias.", Loron replied jestingly, as he pulled a pipe from his coat pocket and started packing it with tobacco. 

"No one knows that name anymore. Tobias Kimin died a long time ago in unmarked grave in a land far away", Mark responded, his tone short.

"Of course, my mistake", Loron acknwoledged, pulling a steel rod from his tobacco puching and stricking it sharply against the top of his pipe. A fwe seconds later the dark glow of burning tobacco illuminated his face and he pulled on the pipe deeply, illuminating the pair of them.

"So", Loron continued, "what emergency brings you to call on a simpleton like me to meet you so urgently?"

"Well, I was hoping that you could tell me. What on earth is going on in this city?"

"Lots of things, I think you may need to be more specific. There is of course the harvest festival which there have been plenty of preperations for. Or perhaps, you are talking about the Mayor's daughters wedding, which was the talk of the town last month. Or are you talking about the ten Planet Drinkers who are roaming around the city, trying to assasinate the king".

It appeared as though rumours were flying though the ranks. It appeared as though one Drinker had transformed into an army through retellings. According some the inside of the Royal Mint had been leveled by an eight foot giant, in it's destructive rage. In other tales the Planet Drinker took the form a beautiful seductress who would enslave you with just a stare. Suffice it to say, any story that was even remotely truthful was more likely coincidence than reasoned thought.

"And what do you think?", Marcus inquired.

"Well, I think it is likely that a couple of Planet Drinkers were in the Royal Mint the other night, but by now I am guessing they are long gone".

"And their motive?"

"Who can know. I am guessing that you know more than me."

"The Captain thinks they're assasins."

"Yes, well he would. It's his job to be paranoid", Loron conceded.

Marcus stood deep in thought while Loron continued to suck on his pipe, illuminating the two of them. It appeared as though there wasn't going to be any simple solutions to this one. He was going to have to use old fashioned detective work here. He continued to quiz Lorin for any truths might be gleaned from a thousand disparate rumors, but it didn't seem promising. 

Handing a bag of gold to Lorin, Marcus started to take his leave. 

"I will send you a message if I find anything else out", Loron said putting out a hand. "Good doing business with you as always."

"Indeed, please do. Take care of yourself Loron", and with that they seperated ways. It was time for Marcus to do what he did best. Search and Destroy.

Emlyn could feel Meranis start to peek over the horizon, her pain easing slightly as its warmth washed over her. Her body still ached, but with Meranis up, she would be able to shuffle around. She slipped out of bed, threw on a dress, bending over as she couldn't quite pull her arms above head height. She suddenly felt cold, and she pulled her blanket off her bed, tucked it around her and suffled through the door.

As she entered the dining room Orin looked up from his papers and fixed her with a calm gaze.

"Good to see you are  back to galivanting around". Emlyn gave a small smile, and sat down on the chair opposite him and pulled her blanket around herself.

"Well, I am glad that you are up, I was going to come an get you in a few minutes anyway", he said, removing his glasses and rubbing his eyes with his open palms.

"We are escaping tonight", he continued, "this afternoon in fact, as soon as Meranis has set".

Emlyn knew what that meant, and she wondered whether she had the will to continue. To make her flight without Meranis to stengthen her may literally be more than she could handle.

"So, we are hunted then?", Emlyn inquired.

"It would seem so. It makes sense for them to do so, and in the three days you have been laid up, they will have been scouring the city for you."

Orin replaced his glasses and shuffled through his papers looking for the relevant ones.

"I have these. And these", he said pushing the documents to her. "But more than that, one of my contacts tells me directly that they have recalled their elite Scryer team to the city".

"Attempted assasination?", Emlyn whispered in an exasperated voice looking up from the stolen parchment. "Is there something you aren't telling me?"

"This is the first I have heard of it I assure you. It's not the Houses position to assasinate kings. And I would have told you if that was our goal."

"No you wouldn't", Emlyn quipped back.

"No. I wouldn't", Orin acknowledged. "But there is no assasination plot." 

"No, it wouldn't make any sense. But it most certainly is an odd conclusion to draw" Emlyn said thoughtfully.

"Not really. For all we know the King may just have happened to be at The Mint that night, for reasons unknown to us.", Orin hypothesised. "It would most certainly explain how the guards arrived there so quickly. Also, you might not be aware but the captain of the Royal Guard was there. Very peculiar."

That made sense to Emlyn, but Orin still wasn't convinced. They discussed the different possibilities, but the fact was that it was all irrelevant now. There was nothing for them to do at this point but return to Verris and report to the House.

"Well, on that point, I have a point. But I suspect that you are not going to like it.

"Alright, this looks like the place", Jake said as Marcus rode up to the Jake, taking in the strong sea breeze of the peer. "An old man returned in the middle of the night with a young girl, fifteen or sixteen the innkeeper reckons, covered in blood. Says they were attacked by footpads".

Jake, motioned over to the inn in question, a moderate place on the waterfront. Nice enough for a artisan engraver and ward, sa their quarry claimed to be, but he most certainly wouldn't take Jessica there. It was just the kind of place that you would stay if you didn't want to be noticed. Not too many guards trying to keep order among ruffians and not too many night patrols by the city guard, trying to make the rich feel safe and sound.

"And it was definitely the night of the attack?", Marcus inquired.

"Yes. I am pretty sure these are the ones. The innkeeper says that the man, Derin Tomlin is the name he uses by the way, settled his account this morning. He must be fleeing today. But he was still at the inn when she left a two bells ago."

Marcus thought deeply. 

"No. This guy isn't stupid. He knows that if we are watching him, settling his account would indicate his intentions." Marcus furrowed his brow, his horse twitching, responding to the anxiety of its master. Marcus spoke slowly. "He must be trying to force our hand. Meranis is approaching it's zenith. He wants us to attack when his Drinker is at her full power."

Yes, that did seem logical Jake thought. This is what it must be like to battle true opponents. Trying to always think one step ahead of each other. But if their opponents were truly brilliant then surely they would be aware that Marcus would know what they were trying to do? So they must have made their move knowing that it would make Marcus wary of attacking. But to what end?

"We wait", Marcus announced. "Whatever their plan is, the fact is that they aren't going anywhere with Meranis up. They are going to wait for Meranis to fall, and then try and slip away in the crowds, to some pre-arranged exit strategy". 

Jake nodded solemly, trying to think of what they would need to do.

"And if they flee now?"

"They won't. They are hoping that we will attack while we can identify her, thinking that they can slip by annonymously. If they do try to slip out with Meranis in conjunction, the target will be obvious and I will follow while you get backup. But they won't. Trust me."

---

"It's time to go", Emlyn said rising to her feet. Her legs shook slighly as her anxiety swelled in her chest. If they were truly hunted as Orin suspected then they were taking a huge gamble. 

But as Meranis started sinking below the horizon Emlyn and Orin prepared themselves for their escape. Orin had already destroyed all their non-essential equipment. They had slowly filled the fire with their ciphers and codes. All their bulky tools had been broken down and distributed in the back alleys of the surrounding neighbourhood and their extra clothes had been distributed to the vagrants. By the time any tracking dogs get their nose on the garments, they would be filled with the odours of the slum.

All they had left was a small bag on each of their backs for their essential gear. Their belts held their weapons and anything that they couldn't do without, in the event that they had to drop their bags in a chase. Finally they had their emergency provisions strapped under their clothes, in the event that the worst would happen.

As Meranis finally winked out, Emlyn nodded to Orin. 

"You ready?" He inquired, a grave look on his face. Emlyn swallowed, and tried to speak, but her voice caught in her throat. She felt sick. If she opened her mouth she was afraid that she might spill her lunch. In the end she just nodded.

"Lets go."

---

"Here they come" Jake said as the pair exited the front of inn. "Just as Meranis sets, just as you said. Marcus just nodded.

They had eschewed their uniforms, instead taking the clothes of the surrounding crowds. This would take tact, alacrity and skill. And if even the smallest thing gave away their intentions, their quarry would flee. In any normal circumstances they would have been able to call on a battalion of guards to apprehend these terrorists. But according tot Marcus, The Captain had been very clear that this was to be absolutely secret. And the city watch wasn't known for it's discression.

"Lets go" Marcus said, and slipped into the crowds, hiding in plain site as he tracked his victim. Jake followed him and swept a wide arc around the boardwalk, trying to keep his eye on the assasins, Marcus and his feet while attempting not too look suspiscous. His heart beat started to rise as he watched Marcus getting closer and closer. Marcus' eyes spun wildly in his head, seeking out every avenue of attack and every possible danger. 

Jake turned in towards the assasins, trying to blend in with the crowd as much as possible. Inch by inch he got closer and closer, and finally he was behind them, walking along oblivious to world, watching out of the corner of his eye as Marcus converged on him from far right. Slipping effortlessly through the masses Marcus approached at a startling pace.

And suddenly he was on them. Jakes heart raced as Marcus dived forward and threw his fist in a wide arc into her stomach. In a blur, time passed slowly and Jake saw the girl slouch over, crying out in pain as Marcus' full power came into contact with her. Suddenly guardian swept his hand to his belt and suddenly produced a knife. 

In one smooth underarm motion he broguht the knife to bear on Marcus, but Jake's training had already kicked in and he found himself barreling forward, and before he was aware he had wrapped his arms around the would be assasin and tackled him into the dirt, the knife going sprawling into the dirt.

As the world spun, Jake glimpsed Marcus take on the Planet Drinker. It wasn't much of a fight. At roughly treble her weight there was no contest. She sprawled on the ground crying out for help. Marcus aimed a large sweeping kick at her torso and she simply whimpered, unable to fight back.

But Jake's opponent was not ready to go out so quickly. He bucked and kicked as Jake held onto him with all his strength. They rolled over and over and the man gesticulated wildly, hitting Jake's head into the ground repeatedly as Jake cursed and shouted. 

Finally, after what felt like an age Jake finally found himself on top and threw the assasin into an head lock. At first he struggled wildly, but eventually he accepted the inevitable and he finally fell limp.

A large crowd had formed around them and Jake could hear the city guard approaching, last to an incident as usual. He glanced at Marcus just in time to see him pull his finger out of the back of Drinkers throat as she threw up violently on the paving stones. With that Marcus threw a black sack over her head and began to bind her hands viscously behind her back and Jake followed suit with his prisoner.

Once the bonds were secure Marcus raised his prisoner to her feet. He kicked through the girls lunch with his boot, but there was no Planet Well. But yo could never be too carefull.

"WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?"

A roar burst from the leader of the patrol, who's eyes fumed and sword swayed in hand eagerly hoping to spill someone's blood.

"Just capturing two counterfeiters sir. On the King's Justice.", Marcus said, producing his official writ, inked in beautiful cursive script and signed by The Captain of the Guard himself.

The lietentant's eyes dashed across the page, his face darkening as he slowly realized the unbridled power that the writ provided them. Finally he handed back the parchment sharply and saluted.

"Excellent. Now may we borrow two of your horses please" Marcus said, smiling widely. The lietenant's face flashed to pure anger, but he pointed and led on and Marcus and Jake followed him, pulling their unwilling prisoners with them.

As they Jake threw his prisoner over his horse, he heard the girls sobs beside him. A pang of sorrow went out from him for a second. Not for the pain that she had suffered, but for what she was about to suffer. 


20.
---

The girl had finally stopped struggling by the time that they had carried her into the keep. She had fought and scratched and screamed, before Marcus finally gagged her with his own scarf and cursed her with every threat under the sun.

They had taken their prisoners to the Scryers Hold, the one place where they could safely place a Planet Drinker. Their holding cells were buried deep, and warded against every possible mean by which a Drinker might gain power.

They dumped her to the ground in a dank dark cell, illuminated only by flaming torches, set in cast iron brackets. Jake dragged her into the corner, and clamped manacles around each of her arms and legs. He checked and double checked the restraints before returning to the door.

"Hey you", he shouted to one of the guards, who ran in and stood to attention.

"You are going to sit stand by this door and watch this prisoner directly. Do not approach the prisoner. Do no take your eyes off the prisoner. If you rest your eyes or fall or asleep you might not wake up again."

The soldier stared at the hooded creature bound in the corner, and gulped nervously.

"I am going to position a soldier on the outside of the door. Check in with him regularly. If you see anything odd going on, report it."

And with that Jake left the cell, locking the door behind him. 

"She's secure", he informed Marcus, who was leaning nonchalantly, in the corridor. 

"It's hard to believe that she is the biggest threat to the realm isn't it?", Marcus said, as he made his way out of the holding cells.

"Yeah, I have never fought a Drinker so young. Seems really odd that any kingdom would deploy her without backup."

"Well, we will have all the answers we need soon enough. I have sent a runner to the Keep, to confirm the succesful pickup." 

Marcus paused, as he was let throguh the exit doors of the holding cells, returning to the well lit courtyard of the Scryers Hold. 

"We just need to go through their bags, fill out the paper-work, and we might even be able to get home become sundown", Marcus continued. 

---

Orin couldn't tell how much time had past. It felt like days, but he doubted that more than six bells had been struck since he had been captured. 

Lying in the dark, time seemed to draw out like a blade. Every thought imaginable ran through his head. Every creak, and echo in the deep recesses of the his cell sounded like Emlyn's screams.

Orin rolled over, and took a deep breath, trying to save his energy. While there was breath, there was hope, but no matter which way he looked at it, he couldn't remember being in such a tight spot. He had taken a gamble and he had lost. But that is why you always had more plans...

Of course they had been watched. They should have left straight away, but Orin didn't want to risk Emlyn's health after a fight like that. But they had waited too long, and they had been tracked down. Now their salvation lay in Emlyn's hands.

---

Marcus and Jake looked up from the confiscated bags, their sheets expertly filled out listing the contents in all their startling !!boringnes!!. There was a commotion outside, and they both placed their pens back in their holders, and collected their papers together.

It was clear that they had picked up some, spies. Single-use cipher sheets and detailed maps were stored away carefully in leather binders. Those would be of some use to the code breakers up at the Keep, but nothing that would give leverage to The Scryers.

But it was, the things that were missing that were truly interesting. There was no Planet Well, which seemed odd as the dosier they had received clearly stated theat they had access to one. It wasn't uncommon for a Drinker to swallow their Well if they expected to be captured, but Marcus had been sure to expel an potential threat during the arrest. No Plane Well had been in her stomach or on her person.

There also didn't seem to be any escape paraphinalia. No tickets, or contracts, or writs-of-passage. A little odd, but they may have hidden them somewhere outside of the city, just in case. The really prepared always had a backup plan.

None of this mattered to Marcus. They had them safely captured now, and once the Confessors arrived they would find out anything they wanted to know. It would just be a matter of time.

Marcus led them into the courtyard, where a loud argument was going on between their guards and a group of about eight horse men at the gate. 

"What's going on here?" Marcus exclaimed, approaching the would be trespassers.

"They say they are here to pick up the prisoner you arrested today", the gatekeeper explained. "I told them they cannot enter without authorisation."

"We have the highest authorisation", one of the Horsemen declared, his horse twitching with the nervousness of the scene."

"Of course", Marcus said reassuringly, trying to calm everyone down. "We just have to be careful. It is nearly sundown and we don't like strangers poking around the Scryers Hold after nightfall."

"We ain't strangers.", the horseman replied, holding a scroll in his outstretched hand.

Marcus took the scroll, broke the red seal, noting thie Royal Seal of Kris that adorned it. Placing his spectacles to his eyes darted across the page.

"Of course not. Please, enter. My men will take care of your horses", and Marcus gestured placatingly towards the holding cells. "Your prisoner is right this way. Let me just fill out the paperwork."

"Be quick about it. As you say, it is nearly nightfall. We want to be on our way as soon as possible."

"Follow me", Marcus invited, and stepped quickly in the directions of the cells. 

"I assume that you know the danger that you guys are dealing with?", Marcus enquired?

"We know", one of the figures confirmed.

"Meranis will be up in one hour", Jake replied. "If you do not have this prisoner in your deepest darkest dungeon by then, there is no power in the world that will be able to save you".

"We got it", another of the strangers replied.

The door of the holding cells swung open as Marcus approached, the doorman nodding his head in respect. The low sun, cast long shadows on the floor as they marched down the brick corridor. 

"Please take a seat", Marcus offered as they reache the room where they had just been filling out their ledgers. "Let us just fill out the paperwork. Jake will accompany your men to get the prisoner", and Jake nodded and headed down into the darkness, taking their guests with them. 

The leader, sat down and cracked his knuckles ominously, while Marcus reached for his pen.

"Not, every day that we see a member of The Unbreakable around town. Too see eight of them in one night, I should consider myself lucky", Marcus said lightly, as he filled out the transfer forms.

"I have to say, I don't see why this Drinker is any of your concern, especially, when I got explicit orders from the Captain of the Guard himself to bring her in myself". The Unbreakable's face remained emotionless, almost bored.

"But if you are on the Kings personal business, then I suppose it is none of my concern". Still nothing.

"Please sign here", Marcus said finally, passing the parchment over the table to the man's outstreched hand. The man took the parchment and quickly and elegantly signed his name. "Seven Hundred and Sixty Eight", spelled out in flowing in cursive script.

"Wonderful", Marcus said, putting the form into his leather folder. 

They sat in silence for a moment, until the other Unbreakables finally returned, the prisoner held between them, more walkign than limping, with Jake bringing up the rear. 

"Take her to the keep immediately", Seven Sixty Eight ordered, and four of his men exited, taking their prisoner with them. Four of the Unbreakable remained.

"Now, I believe that you ahve another prisoner, who was in collusion with the Planet Drinker."

"That's correct, a certain Master Tomlin, who we believe was her handler. From the documents that we gathered, he seems to be a Verrisian spy".

"Documents?", the lead Unbreakable asked?

"All listed here", Marcus replied, handing the manifest over. The Unbreakable's eyes darted over the page, a quizzical look on his face

"Nothing, definitive on this list", he finally stated. "I want to tie up the loose ends tonight. I want to interrogate him".

"He is my prisoner. Unless you have another order...", Marcus replied. The leader just stared at him, his cool eyes burrowing into Marcus' skin. "But of course, I will provide every convenience to someone on the King's business. This way please"

21.

Orin felt the two men enter the cell. He could feel the heat of their flamign torches on his skin, but the bag on his head kept him in pitch darkness. He sized them up as they lifted him up by the arms. These guys meant business. Strength radiated from them, and they clearly each had about a foot on him. Without his tools he would be hard-pressed to take on one of them. He would have to wait for his moment.

They half dragged him through the unknown darkness, before roughly pushing him into a chair. He felt restraints being thrown around his arms and then his legs roughly, before finally  his hood was ripped off. His recoiled where he sat in response to the sudden blinding light. He blinked, staring dumbly as figures began to take form.

"Hello, Master Tomlin". The voice was calm and collected, without a hint of menace, making it truly terrifying. The man speakin he hadn't seen before, but he was sat next to the the man who had assaulted them in market. The man who had pinned him to the ground was leaning against the wall.

"What's going on? Who are you people?", Orin replied adopting his Master Tomlin persona, with terror in his voice. There was no way that would fool them, but if you were about to be tortured, it was much easier to continue your protestations of mistaken identity. If he held out long enough he might even begin to believe it.

"I think you will find that this will be a lot easier if you allow us to ask the questions", the man replied.

"I don't know what you think I have done, but I swear I didn't do it! I am a good man, not some kind of cutthro..", Orin said, slightly hysterical know, before his head was suddenly thrust forward into the table by an unseen hand behind him.

"As I was saying, this will be easier if you just answer my questions. Do you understand?" the man continued. Orin collected himself, before nodding shortly, his head aching and still spinning slightly.

"Excellent. What is your name?"

"Tomlin. Derin Tomlin."

"Come now, we both know that's not true. Now, we don't have an inquisitor here, or any specialised instruments, but I am sure that I can find a way to make you more honest". 

His voice remained cool and collected. He could have been talking about how beautiful the weather was, rather than threatening Orin with unimaginable compliance techniques. Orin had to admit, he was in a pretty tight spot. His eyes roamed the cell, looking for something, anything that might give him an idea of what to do.

"Where is my niece?", Orin asked pleadingly. "Is she okay?"

"Oh, I am afraid that your niece isn't with us anymore. But I hope for her sake she is a lot better at answering questions than her uncle. Otherwise things are going to go very badly for her".

Orin's face fell, a look of complete hopelesness finally taking over.

"So, shall we try again. What is your name?"

Orin just started crying, and once again he felt his head violently wrenched into the table in front of him.

"What is your name?"

Bam.

"What is your name?"

Bam.

"What is your name?"

Bam.

The Captain of the Guard watched as the four men rode into the courtyard of the Royal Keep. He leant in the shadows, watching from afar as the men pulled up their horses and transfered their package down, to the men awaiting them who dragged the prisoners away.

The men had a quick discussion, their low whispers echoing through the night sky. It was time to tie up the loose ends. There was a certain poetry to it really. In one blow, he would take out Seargent Marcus, who had so often opposed him, he would replace their weak king and precipitate the requirements for war against Verris all for the good of the realm.

As the horsemen turned around and charged back out the gates to belay his orders, The Captain fo the Guard turned to his own chambers. Now he needed only to wait for his palns to come to fruition.

---

Orin spat blood on the table. The beating had stopped, so he guessed that he should look on the bright side.

On reflection, he doubted that these guys really wanted answers at all. They just seemed to enjoy watching him suffer, which he guessed was fair enough. If you enjoyed inflicting pain on others then at least get paid for doing what you loved. But they clearly, didn't really expect him to give up any real answers.

The knock at the door which had interrupted their conversation was followed by anyother dark robed man entering the room. His inquisitor mumbled some threat about "better habing better answers when he returned", and then followed his acquaintance out of the cell.

"You know, we are eventually going to have all the information that we need. You are only hurting yourself."

The man that had arrested them was talking now. He had sat impassionately throughout his interrogation, a look of disgust on his face.

"I keep telling you, you have the wrong man.", Orin replied.

"Of course." he acknowledged. "I have to admit, I don't like my companions methods. I find them very quite primative really. As you can imagine, I mostly deal with Planet Drinkers. Given enough time, they would sell out their own mothers just be allowed to bask in a small sliver of Planet Light."

"I am sure you care a great deal for your niece.", he continued. "What was her name again? Rosie?". Orin simply sighed. "Well, I am sure you don't want her to suffer what you have suffered. Why not just come clean about everything? Give us no reason to hurt her?"

"She hasn't done anything." Orin moaned. "Whatever sins I may have committed, she is blameless."

"The power is in your hands." his captor replied.

The two men suddenly re-entered. 

"Okay, we are done here." the interrogator said. "Thank you for your time."

The interrogator crossed to the side, and stuck out his hand and captor shook his hand. As the knife sunk into his captor's back, the interrogator declared. "You have been sentenced to summary execution for conspiring in the assassintation of the king!"

Sitting down at the table, the Captain loomed and slowly cracked his knuckles trying to be as imposing as he could. "So, we are about to have a little chat", The Captain said, nodding to one of the guards. The grabbed and the prisoners head yanked his head off the table roughly.

A sixteen year old girl, hair matted to her face with sweat, stared into The Captains head.

The Captain's heart skipped a beat. He stared in shock at her face, tracing every line of her features. True, it had been dark, and fast and violent that night. But there was no getting away from it. This was not the girl that he had fought.

She looked similar, certainly. She was the same age, she had the same hair. But this was a different girl.

His mind reeled. A thousand different thoughts fought for supremacy in his mind. Who was this girl? Was she connected to the spies? Where was the Planet Drinker?  Should he continue the interrogation? Could anyone else tell he was surprised? What should he do now?

Jake strained as he was tackled into the wall by three cloaked Unbreakables. Marcus' scream echoed off the walls of the cell, as the knife was twisted in his back.

"For your involvement in the assasination of the king, you face execution", Seven Hundred and Sixty Eight stated.

Jake tried to kick off the wall, but only succeeded in crashing into the floor painfully.

"So, this is how it ends?", Marcus asked, his voice catching in his throat as he forced the words out slowly.

"I am afraid so.", the executioner replied. "Don't worry, it will all be over soon."

But Marcus wasn't looking at him anymore. His eyes were locked on the door to their cell. And Jake felt it, the cold chill radiating from the other side of the door that could only mean one thing. 

The door splintered open with thundering crash

23.

Emlyn smashed through the door, leaving the trail of unconcious guards behind her. She was too deep to feel Meranis anymore, but her Planet Well was still full. 

She entered to the sight of shocked faces, looking at her in complete bewilderemnt. She seemed to have interrupted some kind of scuffle betweem the jailers. In the corner four were grappling on the ground, the ones at the table seemed to be in the middle of a knife fight, and manacled to a chair sat Orin, blood streaming over his face, but clearly, still lucid.

Emlyn drew on her Well, and kicked her self into the air, flying directly at the men at the table. She evaluated her targets. The man who had arrested "her", was standing with a knife in his back, and posed no threat. But the man opposite him, was radiating danger, and was already moving to defend himself. She threw her fist out and connected with his face perfectly.

The man went out like a light, rolling over head over heels backwards and Emlyn skittered onto the floor, regaining her balance. The men who had been scrabbling in the corner turned and started walking towards her, hidden foot long blades being pulled from within their pitch black robes. The man who had been grappleing with them dashed over to his wounded companion at the table.

"Watch out!", Orin yelled, straining at his chair as he instinctively tried to assist her. Emlyn spun around throwing out a high kick, just in to time to connect with another soldier she hadn't noticed before. The man grunted as he hit the wall behind him, but the distraction had worked and the three men threw themselves on Emlyn, blades flying at her viscously.

Emlyn threw herself to the side, rolling away from her foes as the swords clattered against the tiles where she had just been. Wasting no time, Emlyn jumped up the wall and grabbed an iron bracket on the wall. Her hands burned as she heaved pulling the bracket from the hard stone and projected the burning coals at her attackers.

They threw up their arms reflexively, but the burning hot coal dust fileld the air, and they screamed as it hit eyes and skin. They choked for air, and their screams resounded in the small room as the embers filled their lungs. Emlyn took a deep breath and ran at them and after a quick succession of blows the men lay on the floor.

Emlyn breathed deeply as she surveyed the destruction that surrounded her. All the cloaked men lay incapacitated on cold flagstones, but the two uniformed men that had arrested Orin and her body double remained, cowering by the table. The younger man, had pulled his sword, but clearly had no interest in using it.

"Leave them Rosie", Orins voice rang in the air, bring her back to reality after her adrenaline and Meranis fueled rage. "Release me", he then said, directing his words to the two uniformed men.

The older man sat for a second, before nodding to his companion, who pulled a ring of keys off one of the fallen guards and started to remove Orin's restraints. 

Orin rubbed his wrists as the manacles fell away. "I think it is time for us to make our escape. Again", he stated, a tired look on his face. "But I think the same goes for the two of you doesn't it?"

"We can fight our way out" Emlyn stated, eyeing the two uniformed men with suspiscion. "I wasn't spotted. And once we get back to the courtyard Meranis will guide our way".

Orin continued to look at his captors. "It seems clear that your country has turned on you. I suspect that by now that your king has been assasinated, and you will be held accountable." You could see the mechanation on their faces as they ran the evidence through their minds. They didn't want it to be true, but there was no other evidence. Even the Unbreakables wouldn't be allowed to kill a Skryer in the Skryers Hold unless they had evidence of treason.

And as Marcus thought about it, all the individual pieces seemed to fall into place. It really was obvious. The clandestine meetings, haing to bring in the Drinker by themselves. They had been set up since they entered the city. Marcus didn't want it to be true, but that didn't mean it wasn't. The only question was, where did he go from here? Fight or flight?

"Sir. My family. Do you think...?", the younger man said, clasping his hands on his head.

"No, your family is fine, trust me", the elder man said. "At least, as long as you stay away from them."

A pause and then he continued. "We flee. Follow us."

"Our bags", Orin replied as the man stood up from his chair with a grim face as he fought his internal agony. "I can give you something for the wound that will slow the bleeding and numb the pain."

"This way. I am Marcus by the way. This is Jake." the elder man said.

"Derin Tomlin, in case you didn't hear me the first fifty times", Orin said with a wicked smile.

THE END?

Epilogue.

"Why did you let them go?"

Orin stared out at the sunrise, growing along the dark blue horizon of the ocean. He leant against the wooden railing, taking in the salty air.

"They were no use to us in Verris", Orin replied. "We would have been forced to imprison them. And then we would be hamstrung. Whereas, outside, who knows what use they might be.

Emlyn nodded slowly. "You will have to choose your words wisely when explaining this to the comittee".

Orin sighed deeply. "I suspect that there are going to be a lot of difficult questions when we get home Emlyn. And I don't think we are going to like them."

"How can we be blamed for what happened?", Emlyn asked incredulously.

"Someone has to be. It can't be no one's fault." Orin said sadly. "But lest not worry about that now. There will be plenty of time for that in the future."

"For now, let us just be thankful", he continued.  "We could both very easily be dead". 

"Maybe you old man. I don't die so easily". Orin smiled silenty, and put his arm around her, clutching her close. "You know. I don't think we have ever simply watched a sunset together. No training, no objectives. Just stopping to enjoy its beauty and its warmth"

"Is this what it is like to watch Meranis rise?", Orin asked neutrally.

"No. She is cold, and sharp as steel. I need her with every fibre of my being. But I couldn't share her with you. She holds me jelously to her."

Emlyn stuck her arms around Orin, and he hugged her tighter as they finally headed for home.
