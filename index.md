Prologue
---
The usual quiet and serenity of the palace had given way to the anxiety and fear that always accompanied uncertainty. The bells rang out loudly, signalling an attack, but there were no enemy soldiers, no conquering armies. 

Captain Jenkins, the first of the Kings Guard, rushed through the ornate passages, their usual pristine cleanliness dissolved into disarray. Whispers and shouting echoed through the hallways in equal measure, members of the royal household staring anxiously from their chamber doors and holding onto each other for comfort.

He passed couple of guards who were half way down the corridor, drawn away from their post the commotion. “Stand at your post!” he shouted, and they jumped backwards, retaking their position beside the door. 

“Oh Captain, there you are” another soldier declared, in relief, forgetting all formalities.

“Lead the way Seargent Kyle”, the Captain responded, putting enough emphasis in his voice to remind him to maintain his discipline.

“The King’s chamber’s Sir”, he Seargent Kyle replied, and The Captain placed a hard look on his face and marched onwards.

They continued on, deep into the keep, towards the safest of places, the inner sanctum where the King’s chambers lay. 

Where was the discipline, The Captain thought. These were meant to be the best of the best, the king’s personal guard. And yet here they were, no one sure of what they should be doing, milling around like chickens with their heads cut off.

“I will have order here!”, The Captain roared and each guard there stood to attention right where they were. He gave orders quickly as he walked onwards into the kings personal rooms. Once he had issued the undisciplined halfwits their orders, he entered the kings chambers.

He looked upon the room. Carnage. Everything in the room had been tossed aside, the clear and resonating signs of a struggle were clear to see. Vases smashed on the ground, one of the bed curtains had been pulled and now hung from one sad hook. Blood, there was so much blood. From the bed, to the floor to the wall, a thick trail of life stretched across the room.

And at the end of the trail, slumped against the wall: The King. He was covered in more than a few blade marks all along his left arm and face, and huge gouge sat in his chest, just below his heart. 

He must have fought bravely. The thought flashed through the Captain’s head. At seventy years old, for him to fight back against an assassin’s blade, when attacked in the middle of the night? There are some skills that a warrior never forgets.

But it had all been in vain. From the second the assassin had penetrated their defences the king had been dead. What did they do wrong? Not enough guards? Not enough walls?

There was no point second guessing yourself. The guard crossed to the bed and took up a sheet and covered the kings naked body with it, just as an old man barrelled into the room, out of breath, gasping.

“I am afraid that you are too late Doctor Virchow”, he said as the old man entered. The First Doctor of the Realm looked so odd. 

His usual illustrious clothing, with velvet and golden thread embroidery were replaced this evening by a cheap full length shift of cloth. He wasn’t wearing any shoes. Funny how something like that seems so odd at a time like that The Captain thought.

The surgeon crossed slowly to the king side, his bare feet wading into the large pool of blood around the king. He knealt down and put his hands to the back of his hand to the kings face, and then placed his palms all the way down his chest and to his legs. Finally coming to terms with the fatal truth, he sighed deeply and stood back.

The Captain placed his hand lightly on the old man’s shoulder. 

“We knew each other since we were kids”, the doctor said quietly. “My father used to bring me with him when he came to examine his father. We used play together sometimes.”

“We will get whoever did this Rufus” The Captain said, but the old surgeon just looked away. They sat down on the bed, and the surgeon just looked at his feet.

“Sir”, a guard said, standing to attention.

“Report”, The Captain clipped.

“We have them sir, the assassin”

“Where?” The Captain asked, standing up suddenly.

“They are being taken to the cells as we speak. Found unconscious in the West Gallery sir, knife still in hand”

“Let’s go” he said, and The Captain marched down towards the dungeons, as a group of apprentice surgeons charged past him to the king chambers, bags of equipment in hand. He could hear Rufus talking to them quietly as he marched to the dungeons.

As he walked down the wide passages of the royal keep, each of the guards stood to attention, showing the respect due the Captain of the Guard. Some of them looked so young, hardly ready for the war that was now inevitable.

It hardly seemed fair at all, being sent into the fray, barely more than children. But had he not been that age, even younger, when the last war broke out? Hadn’t he done everything he could to enlist? To defend the kingdom and honour the king?

Somehow it didn’t seem the same anymore, forty years had changed him beyond recognition. His many commendations for battles won and victories taken seemed a distant memory now. The events of another man’s life.

But if it was going to be war, he was going to ensure that they were going to win. And the first step was to find out who was behind this heinous crime.

Descending the cold stone steps, the steel gates clinked open as he approached them. They were deep underground now, fires burnt in brackets attached all along the world, the only light in a world of perpetual darkness.

“The prisoner is ready for questioning Captain”, the ancient jailor said, a toothless grin on his face, clearly eager to have a new victim to maltreat. 

“No one else has spoken to the him yet?”, the captain asked.

“No sir, the assasin only just regained consciousness” the guard said, with a hint of laughter in his voice. “But I think you might find them a little different from what you are expecting Captain”, he said, finding his key on his giant ring of keys.

The jailor turned the long key in the lock and swung the cell door open and the Captain looked in the door. Two guards sat either side of a table, and the prisoner sat, face down on the table, manacles snaking from the floor to the his limbs.

Sitting down at the table, the Captain loomed and slowly cracked his knuckles trying to be as imposing as he could. “So, we are about to have a little chat”, The Captain said, nodding to one of the guards. The grabbed and the prisoners head yanked his head off the table roughly.

A sixteen year old girl, hair matted to her face with sweat, stared into The Captains head.

One Week Earlier



Put some stuff in here. Well, lets just have an entirely different chapter maybe. I dunno, does it really matter?

Wasting no time, she slipped a key from the bag strapped to her belt and jammed it into the door the soldiers had been guarded. She held her breath as she turned the key, but the lock fell and she stepped into the dark room beyond.

Blinking, she started to make out the room she had worked so hard to enter. Simple and practical, the room of a clerk. The simple desk and drab tapestry on the wall gave no indication of why this room would need to be guarded at all times. Still, Emlyn knew better than anyone that looks could be deceiving. 

And there it was, on the centre of the desk in plain sight: a purple envelope with the red seal of Verris stamped on the back. She picked it up, stuffed it in her bag, locked the door behind her and headed back down the corridor the way she had come. Ten minutes later she was back in the bright sunlight, looking over the sea surrounding the city of Ren. 

2.
----
Emlyn couldn't help looking over her shoulder as she headed down the wide streets towards the docks. There was no way anyone could have seen her leave the keep. If they had, she would be dead now. Still, she couldn't shake the feeling every eye was staring at her. 

In the hustle and bustle of the market streets, there was no way to discern a word from the inhuman yells of those trying to sell their wares, all trying to outdo each other in  volume, if not in price or quality. She slipped through the throngs of people all jostling each other as they tried to make their journeys.  

Stoping only to dissuade a young pick-pocket with a gentle nudge, she headed down to the waterfront to the Apple Pony, the backwater inn she had left just two hours previously. The  smell of saltwater and the stench of too many people in one place filled her nose as she neared the inn.

Finally freeing herself from the crowd, she saw Orin sitting at one of the tables in the sun outside the front of the inn, glass of wine in hand with an empty glass beside the bottle itself.

"What took you so long? I almost finished this bottle by myself", Orin said humorously, a patronising grin gripping his face. 

Emlyn sat down next to him, lifted the empty wine glass up to her eye and look at him through it. "You're lying", she said quietly, trying to keep her face as straight as possible. "There is no way you could have known that I would be back so soon". They locked eyes, neither of them wanting to give away their thoughts. "That mean, that you have been waiting here for me to return, to mock me no matter how early I was", she said, placing the glass back on the table, not dropping eye contact for a moment. 

"What? Do you think I would play such juvenile games?", Orin replied in mock offense. "I am a busy man I will have you know Rosie, I cannot simply spend my entire day thinking of clever things to say and do to trick you people I will have you know!"

Her faced cracked and she began to smile. "Of course not" she replied as she slipped the purple envelope under the table into his outstretched hand.

"No matter", he said waiving his hand. "I have great news Rosie" he said, continuing his charade of happy indifference. "A letter reached me this morning" Orin said, pulling the purple letter out in plain sight for all to see. So much for discretion. "And I believe, it contains a great treasure! Shall we open it?" he inquired dramatically?

"Here Master Tomlin?" Emlyn said, somewhat surprised. "Wouldn't it be safer to address its contents in private?"

"Nonsense child, who would ever want to keep good news a secret?" he replied, opening the letter messily. "Why look at this", he said showing her the piece of paper contained within. "It seems to be the betting slip to yesterday's winning track horse. What great fortune! Who could have been so kind as to send me such a gift?"

"Who indeed? It would appear that you have some very lucky friends" Emlyn replied, sighing to herself about the shear obviousness of it all now. 

It now seemed so obvious that Orin would never have sent her on a truly important mission on her first assignment in foreign country. Hadn't everything been too easy? Only two guards, almost no security to speak of. She was starting to feel truly silly when Orin interrupted her train of thoughts.

"And generous", he continued. "Well, this truly deserves to be celebrated, let us raise a glass together" he said as he took up the bottle and started filling the empty glass.

"If you insist" she replied, holding her glass steady as Orin started to fill it.

"Of couse my dear Rosie, we are in Ren, not Verris. Why even a sixteen year old such as yourself can drink a little wine!" he said lightly. "Now come", Orin continued, "To good fortunes!"

"To Good fortunes" Emlyn replied and she started to sip her wine. 

Orin knocked his glass back in one full gulp and started pouring himself another glass. "Right, well it seems to me that we must be heading to the races to collect our winnings. And there is no time like the present, so let us finish off this fine bottle and be on our ways, we have a fine day of work ahead of us".

3.
----
They were moving quickly through the streets, back towards the keep.  The cobbled streets were already starting to show signs of the detritus that builds up anywhere that sees thousands of people and animals every day.  Orin rummaged through his satchel as he walked, drawing things out apparently at random, with Emlyn a pace or so behind.  The bonhomie had melted away as soon as they got out of sight of the inn.

"It occurs to me darling Rosie," he said "that your efficiency in completing your errand may have complicated things."

"What do you mean?"

"In the years you've been running errands for me, you have learnt many things.  How many of those things would you say you used today?"

Emlyn dodged a group of children wanting to shine her shoes.  She didn't really know what he was driving at, so she stayed quiet.

"As I thought.  Let's come at this from a different angle. You completed your errand *skillfully* and quickly, correct?"  She nodded. "So, I am pleased with that. However, what is important to me other than efficiency?"

"Being the last at the table."

Orin barked a laugh. "Good answer. Yes indeed, being the last at the table. And seated at that table with us at the moment is our worst enemy." He paused in his flow to turn a corner. "Stop it!" he said suddenly.

"What?"

"You're imagining what he might look like." Orin spun suddenly, grabbing her shoulders and staring into her eyes. Even though she had known him for years and had seen him do this before, it still gave her the chills for a moment at how completely he had transformed himself with the things he had taken from the satchel as he walked. Only the slate grey eyes were the same. "I have not met him, you have not met him, but we know he's there, and he looks like the serving girl at the inn, or the market seller behind his stall.  If you ever do meet him face to face, he will look like whatever he wants to look like.  We didn't have to worry about him so much when we were in Verris, but now as I told you earlier, we are in Ren.  Quickly, tell me two things you would not want him to know about you."

"What I look like and where I'm staying."

"Both things that we don't want him to know, yes, but I'm thinking more fundamental.  Firstly, that you exist at all. Secondly that you are a *drinker*."  He almost hissed the last word.  "Over there is an inn that soldiers on the way back from their shifts occasionally have a beer in.  Draw your cloak around you, go in and sit in the corner on the left.  Don't let anyone see your face."

Emlyn had been waiting in her corner for only a few minutes before Orin came in with a young soldier.  They seemed the best of friends, although the younger soldier walked a little unsteadily and had a bandage around his head.  They sat at the booth on the opposite side of the room, but she found that by moving around a little, she could find a spot where the acoustics let her hear very clearly what he was saying.

"This? Oh it's not as bad as it looks.  I can't talk about it really", he was saying, "my officer told me that this stuff was all very hush hush."  He took a sip of the tankard he'd been given. Orin said something, to which he snorted.

"He was beaten up by a girl you say?  Some of them are surprisingly strong, as I've had reason to know myself.  Do you think there might be a girl planet drinker around?"

Orin said something she couldn't make out, but the sound changed.  She looked across, and saw the young soldier leaning away from Orin, his face contorting with fear.  She moved around until she could hear what Orin was saying:

"not dead right now is because your uncle whom I know to be a solid man vouched for you.  I don't think you understand the gravity of the situation you're in. There's not a man in this city who wouldn't kill you for the reward that would be placed on your head were they to know that you occasionally do jobs for me, and there's not a man in Verris who wouldn't kill you if they knew you were placing my mission here in danger through loose talk. If I have to come and find you again, it will be the last time.  Do I make my meaning clear?"

The young soldier seemed to have something wrong with his throat.  Orin stood up, slapped him jovially on the shoulder, and walked out.  Emlyn waited a short while then followed.

4.
----
Apparently scaring the soldier had lightened Orin's mood.  He whistled as he walked.

"Was that really necessary?" Emlyn asked.

"You tell me.  I didn't realise you had a phylactery, so I rather expected you to use a little more guile on that one, and if you had, that soldier probably wouldn't have needed reminding that he should keep his opinions to himself. What I hoped you learnt from that is that sometimes it avoids complications to use less direct methods, and the less that you reveal about yourself the better."

"How about the lesson 'if I want something done a particular way, I should explain that before sending someone to do it'?"

"Now *Rosie*, I'm currently in a good mood. Let's keep it that way."

She stayed silent for a while.  "So where are we headed?"

"To meet an old acquaintance of mine" Orin replied, "A real lowlife like myself who has managed to cut a life for himself here."

"Going to catch up on old times?" Emlyn asked

"Something like that. But if there is one thing I know about Ben it is that he always knows more than he should. And unless I am very much mistaken he will be in need of a little coin"

They headed along the harbour water, once again braving the crowds. Orin took long commanding strides towards his target. He slipped through the crowds, never once stopping for others, but no one ever seemed to notice him. His easy, elegant walk didn't ask for other people to let him through, he simply did. Emlyn hurried along in his wake.

Passing through the market the mouth-watering odours of freshly cooked fish and hot bread hit Emlyn. Suddenly breakfast seemed so long ago, and the wine was leaving her light headed. Fumbling for her purse, she acquired a couple warm loafs of bread.

"Here we are" Orin announced, approaching the grimiest pub that Emlyn had ever seen. The walls, presumably once white, were were water stained to the point where Emlyn wouldn't have been surprised if they had barnacles stuck to them. A heavily faded sign above the door announced that they were entering The Fish Wife.

The inside confirmed what the outside promised. The stench of vomit and sweat hung heavy in the air from the raucous party the night before and the endless evening of drunken debauchery before. Its current patrons were still sober, but come the end of their menial shift on the dock that evening, they would transform into a hailstorm of drunken slurs, wild threats and unskilled brawling. 

"Hey ho, Jacko" Orin exclaimed, throwing his arms in an embrace around a man who lifted him off the ground in a huge bear hug.

"So good to see you again old friend" the man replied.

Orin hadn't lied about meeting a lowlife. Everything about the man told of his daily battles. He was large; a good half a head taller than Orin, and twice, with arms which Emlyn reckon could have picked up a warhorse. With armour on. His face held so many cuts that it could easily have been mistaken for a map of a faraway land at first glance. And some of them were clearly fresh.

But despite all this, Emlyn couldn't help but feel affection for him. It was something about his smile, the way that it went all the way to his eyes. 

The man released Orin from his embrace, returning him to the floor, where they started shaking hands. 

"Gonna be sundown by the time you too are done greeting each other" said the barman sarcastically.

"Right you are Tom" <<Barmen are always called Tom>> said the man. "Please, two of your best beers and a…" he said trailing off as he made eye contact with Emlyn.

"Oh how rude of me" said Orin "Jack let me introduce Rosie, my niece. Rosie this is my old friend Jack"

"Hey who are you calling old?" Jack retorted "You are old enough to be her father!"

"Well yes, like I said, she is my niece"

"Well what will your niece be having?" the barman interrupted, pulling down the glasses off the shelf behind him. "And I hope she can pay for you all, I can't remember the last time Jack paid his tab"

"Come now, I thought that was water under the bridge Tommy"

"Beer down your throat more like. And not a copper piece to show for it" the barman replied

"Don't you worry, these are on me" said Orin placing a silver coin on the bar. The coin disappeared into the barman's hand so fast that Emlyn could have sworn he must have been a magician.

"I'll have a half" Emlyn said hopefully.

"You most certainly will not!" Orin said light heartedly. "What would your mother say? Why I doubt, she would ever let me under her roof again, if she heard I had let you drink!". 

Jack laughed good naturedly. "Go on Ben, just a half"

"Absolutely not, she will have cup of tea"

"'Fraid you out of luck mate" the barman replied. "Does this look like Queens garden party? Best I can do is water if the ladies not drinking"

"Water it is then".

They took their drinks and sat down at an empty table. They started talking about old times and what were they doing in Ren. Orin told the lies they had practiced so many times. Jacks eyes betrayed that he could tell something didn't quite add up, but he never said a word.

Once they had finished their drinks Orin leant his head in conspiratorially and started speaking in a hushed whisper.

"We are going to have a private talk, stay here Rosie, we will be back in a little bit" said Orin.

"Not a chance old friend", Jack broke in. "It has been okay while I have been here but the second I leave half this bar is going to start making a move on this beautiful flower of yours"

"I can take care of myself" Emlyn said defiantly.

"I am sure you can. But I am sure you two don't want to draw attention to yourselves" he said conspiratorially.

"He's right Rosie, why don't you go back to the market, we will meet you there in half a bell."

They left the pub and Orin and Jack headed into a back alley on the left while Emlyn slowly made her way back to the market.

5.
----
Emlyn wandered around the market, dragging her heels, trying not to look at everything too quickly and be forced to go around again. She couldn't help feeling slightly left out when Orin went off by himself. She understood the importance of discretion. Informants were a lot more open when they were talking to people that they knew well. And Orin would fill her in on any of the important details later.

But that didn't make it any less annoying. There was something about being a spy, you craved information, no matter how unimportant or inconsequential. And there was nothing more galling than being told that there was something that you couldn't know. 

Finding a low sea wall, Emlyn sat down and pulled a book from her coat pocket. A particularly dry account of the history of Kingdom of Kris, it's capital Ren and their countless wars against Verris. The historian was of course completely biased. 

The evil of the Kingdom of Kris held knew no bounds. While noble knights of Verris fought with bravery and cunning, the evil forces of Kris we sinful to their bone, raping and pillaging their way across the lands. 

But that was nothing to say of their King and Queen. A family so evil no one had dared challenge them for hundreds of years, for fear of their retribution.

The line between truth and lies were subtle. A man who is described a murderous warlord in one book, will be declared a defender of the innocent in the next. Both could be true.

Of course, whether they were good or bad, just or malevolent, didn't really interest Emlyn. Her years of training in the Royal Palace had drilled the importance of following orders.

What would happen if you told your arm to move, and it decided not to? Or if your one leg decided to walk and the other did not? To work effectively, your legs must trust the orders from your head assuring it that there were no cliffs ahead. 

Kingdoms were just like people. Your mines and farms were your legs, providing you with the your means to propel you through life. Your Armies were like your arms, defending you from others.

And she was the Eyes of the King. The Royal Spies provided The Crown all the information it needed to make the life and death decision the king made every day. Where armies were being marched, supplies being shipped, alliances being broken; all these were the coin of espionage. And of course, more valuable than all of these combined was information about Planet Drinkers.

Few in number, remnants of the ancient royal families, Planet Drinkers were ultimate weapons in hands of every royal family. Their ancient blood gave them powers beyond imagining. The power to fight, hide, <<blah blah>> on a super human level. Even a faintest whisper of a young prince being a Drinker would be enough for a battalion of spies to be deployed to investigate the claims.

Of course the history books had loads to say about the Planet Drinkers. How the unusual celestial order of the planets, the source of all Drinkers power, had allowed a previously weak nation to rise to extrodinary heights, before being destroyed as the planets moved inexorably along their paths allowing another nation to rise.

For Emlyn, being a Planet Drinker had never been much of a blessing. She supposed it could have been worse, had she been born in Kris, she would likely have been murdered, and her entire family with her if it had been discovered that a Drinker had been born so far outside of the royal line.

Still, in Verris drinkers were considered property of the crown, tools to be used, sharpened and maintained, to be deployed in defence of the kingdom at a moment's notice. 

She knew that she should be happy. To be placed in the House of Eyes was one of best outcomes she could have received. Provided as a precious resource, she was one of the only to Drinkers of the House. At the age of 6 she had been assigned to Orin one of the most accomplished spies in the kingdom. Tough not a Drinker, at 35 Orin was at the peak of his fame and power. Well, fame as far as spies could achieve; it was well known among the Council of Elders that Orin was the man to get the job done. But knowing that is strength would soon begin to wane, he knew that it was time to take on an apprentice.

Of course, she showed nothing but contempt to Orin when she first came under his tutelage. Young and scared, her 6 year old self hated everything and everyone; the kingdom for their unjust laws, Orin for his imprisonment of her and most of all her mother, for not protecting her.

Thinking about that time just embarrassed her. It now seemed so clear to her why things had to be the way they were. All things considered her life had turned out rather well. She was strong, fit and well taught. She was well thought of by the House and given ten years she could be the youngest person to ever be elected to the Council of Eyes. Her mother was doing well, and they saw each other often enough and, most important of all, Emlyn had a job that she loved.

There was nothing quite as exciting as trespassing where you weren't wanted. The thrill of game, the excitement of knowing what you shouldn't; it was unlike anything else, a drug that you couldn't duplicate. 

A sudden roar of noise jolted Emlyn from her thoughts. The crowd started boil as everyone started talking at once.

"They're coming. The king is coming!" someone yelled, nearly hysterical, running down the road, informing everyone he came across.

The people all stopped what they were doing and started to head to the road.

"You there, get off your ass and salute your King!", yelled a guard, marching through the market, following the path that the man before him had just taken.

Emlyn locked eyes with the guard confrontationally, before putting her book away and slowly started walking to the road. The guard stared her down, before continuing on his way shaking his head and urging other passers-by to head to the road.

She squeezed past the people to get to the front of the throng standing on both sides of the road. Following the examples of all the other citizens, Emlyn put her fist to her chest, saluting as the first horses of the royal procession came down the street.

It was a fine sight, twenty knights in full parade regalia headed the procession, followed by twenty of the kings personal guard. And then the kings personal carriage passed by. 

Painstakingly crafted, it glittered like a jewel in the bright sunlight. It had been carved to perfection, and covered entirely in gold gilt. Tiger motifs were present through-out the carriage, the official seal of Kris used to point where it became more vulgar than impressive.

The curtains were drawn; no doubt the king didn't want to see the dockworker, merchants, beggars and other lowlifes on his way to his ship.

As the carriage passed another twenty knights brought up the rear. Their searching eyes scanned the crowds, just waiting for an excuse to "deal" with someone who stepped out of line. 

One guard in particular stood out to her. He locked eyes directly with her. As he rode, his persistent gaze held her in place, and worry started to fill her. Did he recognize her? Had she been seen by someone in keep?

Emlyn felt a rough hand grab her shoulder.

"Hey" a voice yelled behind her

6.
---
“Ahhh”, Emlyn yelled jumping a foot in the air, her heart racing. Wresting herself free, she turned on her attacker, a look of fear and danger on her face.

 “Woah, calm down”, the man said, taking a step back, palms raised in a calming tone. He was handsome, Emlyn thought, and not as old as she had thought at first glance. In fact looking at him, he was hardly more than a boy, probably just a few years older than her. But his tallness and his manner made him seem a bit older.

“Sorry, didn’t mean to startle you” he said, reassuringly, “I was just trying to get your attention.”

Emlyn stared at him for a moment. She noticed that she was suddenly holding the power of Meranis, her instinct to save herself overriding her years of meditation. She took a deep breath, letting the power of Meranis leave her. “What do you want?” she said, straightening her hair unconsciously.

“Oh sorry, I just noticed what you were reading, ‘The Antiquity of Krisdom’ by Engust Dalson?’ he said questioningly.

“What?”

“Err, the book. That you are reading. It’s right there, in your pocket” he said pointing.

“Yeah so?”, said Emlyn coldly, still staring at him.

“Well, it is just so seldom that I see other young people intetrerseted in history. In fact, now I think of it, you are the only person I have ever seen read such a book who is under 50”

“What are you trying to say?”

“Nothing!”, he said defensively, suddenly becoming a little flustered. “I just thought it would be nice to talk to another young person for a change.”

Emlyn’s heart was finally starting to calm down after her scare. She knew she really shouldn’t feel resentment towards him. It wasn’t really his fault that she had been put on edge by one of guards. In fact, thinking about it, he hadn’t even really grabbed her that hard, she had just been so nervous that the slightest touch had sent her into a wild panic.

She took another deep breath, “I’m sorry, let’s start this again. My name is Rosie”

“Robert, good to meet you Rosie” he said, putting out his hand for a handshake, a look of relief on his face as she took his hand.

“So you like history do you Robert?” she said with a slight tone of mischief. “Well then, I am sure that you can tell me what the primary cause of the ‘Revolution of Adlard’ was.”

“Of course, though it depends upon which historian you put the most faith in.” he said knowingly. “Now as far as I am concerned Paler gives the most accurate account of the revolution, as he puts the primary cause to be Kings outlawing of weapon exports to the South Sea Islands.

The people of Adlard obviously being primarily metalworkers were hit very hard by this in a year where the crops failed. Suddenly finding themselves without food and with a surplus of weapons, the good people of Adlard decided that perhaps they were perfectly capable of governing themselves”

Robert’s had a perfect oratory voice, Emlyn thought as they walked towards the sea together. When he stated something, he made you believe it as fact. There was no doubt in his voice that was he said was correct. 

“So what do you make of Cheapers account of the revolution being primarily an idealistic one, brought on by a belief in self-government?”

“Bah”, replied Robert discountingly. “Cheaper is, as usual, simply pushing his own agenda, creating martyrs for his cause and evil warlords out of anyone who looked at him the wrong way.”

They sat on a bench by the harbour wall, looking back at the market, as the hustle and bustle of people resumed. Looking down curved wall, Emlyn could still make out the stiring pattern of people moving to attention as the Royal Procession passed by them. She wondered quite how a King got to be so revered so that everyone would drop what they were doing when he passed by. I mean, in Kris of course it was law. But it had not always been so. Once, the people of Kris had done so out of pure admiration. A national love for a single man who had done everything that he could for his people. 

Of course, eventually the king passed away and his son took over. Well, his son was a great man as well, why shouldn’t they show him the respect they had shown his father? And over the generations the sign of respect had become so ingrained in their culture that to not do it would be a sign of defiance. And in this age, no one defied the King.

“So yeah, as far as I am concerned, even then you should take Cheaper’s accounts with a great deal of salt” Robert said, clearly concluding his point which Emlyn had completely missed.

“Hmmm, well it definitely seems that you have an elementary knowledge of some history” she said defying his proud tone. “My turn”

They continued talking, quizzing each other on books they had read, their knowledge of ancient kings and queens long past and other minutia of history. Emlyn suddenly found herself laughing, feeling truly happy for the first time since leaving home. Rob had an easy going attitude, and a quick wit to boot.

Suddenly looking up she saw Orin coming down the street.

“Oh no, look at the time!” she said, looking up at the clock tower which rose over the harbour. “I’ve gotta go, I'm going to be late”

“Wait, where can I meet you again?” Robert said, grabbing her hand suddenly anxious. Emlyn stared down at where he had grasped her, and he suddenly let go, looking away.

“Err, how about here? Tomorrow, at the sixth bell after noon.”

“I will be there”

Emlyn could feel Roberts eyes on her as she briskly walked in Orin’s direction. Silently signalling Orin to follow her, she ducked down a sidestreet and out of sight.

“Meet someone?” Orin asked.

“Just some guy at the market”

“Excellent. Well, I have some news. Best that we were on our way” Orin said, striding off towards their Inn, with Emlyn following close behind.

They sat at their small desk in their room at the Apple Pony, the windows flung open to try and entice any small night breeze into the humid room. The desk had been pulled from its original position facing the wall and placed in the centre of the room. The desk was covered by a large map of the city of Ren and a variety of documents sat on top of that, with Orin's smoking box holding down one end of the map and an empty candlestick holding down the other.

“So, it appears that events move quickly without us. Kris is preparing for war.” Orin said. “And I suspect that this fact is already well known in Verris by now, but in our travels, we must have missed the message.”

Orin took his pipe from his pocket and slowly and methodically started to fill it it. Once he was satisfied that it was just the way he wanted, he stood up, pulled a taper from the mantle and lit his pipe from a candle.

“Our mission has not changed. Whatever developments may have occurred, there is no way for The House to contact as, and they are relying on us to do our jobs quickly and effectively. Once we have achieved our objectives, we can return home via the fastest possible route and deliver our reports”

Orin started to suck on his pipe thoughtfully. Emlyn just sat, waiting for him to finish. When he was in this mood, it was best to let him speak out loud and wait for him to ask her a direct question.

“To wit, we need to somehow put our hands on as much information about the current state of their military as soon as possible. Now, as it so happens, before we arrived, I got wind of a man who might be happy to provide us with such information, for the right price that is.”

Orin pulled on his pipe again, his eyes looking over the glowing bowl conspiratorially. Here it comes, Emlyn thought, he is wondering whether I have figured it out for myself yet. But she was still at a loss as to what things Orin expected her to have put together.

“This man, a senior quartermaster as it so happens, has a thing for the horses. A fine distraction for most men, but for some, a disease worse than any plague”.

Everything suddenly clicked. “Yes, a man like that can get into quite a bit of debt, loose every last penny he has. And then, take more than a few pennies that he doesn’t have, and make a bet which will put all his debt straight.” Emlyn explained with glee.  

“Finding himself so far over the edge, any man would give away a little information to someone who could save him from his fate. You basically had a sure thing, if you pardon the pun. But then his horse won! What were the chances?”

Orin was smilling at her now, his proud eyes lit by his pipe, letting her explain her brilliant deductions.

“Of course you couldn’t have that. It was necessary to ensure that he would misplace his betting card before he could cash it. And then he would have no choice but to take your hand”

“No choice?” asked Orin. “Why wouldn’t he just claim that the money he took from the coffers was stolen by the break in this morning?”

“Hmm”. Yes, that would be the logical choice of action, Emlyn thought. By breaking in I gave him the perfect excuse to explain away any money that he may have lifted from the military coffers. “I don’t know”

“Hmmm” Orin said, imitating her contemplative look. “Well, why don’t you think about it some more. See if you can figure it out”.

Orin shuffled through the papers on his desk, holding them up, trying to read them in the dim light of the room. “Ahhh, here we go”. TBC.

The city looked different at night. Gone were the beggars, merchants and pedestrians, trying to make their way through the packed streets. Now the city belonged to the footpads and criminals, hoping to get lucky and stumble onto those fortunate enough to return from the pub with money still in their pockets.

The city guard took their patrols through the wide boulevards of the inner city, ensuring that no one disturbed the lives of those rich enough to pay the exorbitant rates the noble families set. But, beyond that you were on your own. Of course, that was good if you were one of those people who were up to no good. And Orin and Emlyn most certainly fell into that category.

The trick with travelling at night, was to look like neither a criminal nor a victim, a difficult balance to strike. More than anything, it was how you carried yourselves. As they walked down the road you could see the brigands and ruffians muttering to themselves, before noticing swords and the look of absolute self-confidence that Orin and Emlyn held, and decided that they wanted none of it.

Orin navigated them through the streets and allies with his ever present coolness. He finally stopped, looked around for anyone who might have noticed them. “Okay, here we are. Our quartermaster is in the house with the red door”, Orin whispered, indicating. “As we have already discussed, there is no assurance that this isn’t a trap. You know what to do if everything goes south?”. Emlyn nodded. “Okay, let’s take a quick look around and then I will go for it. You stay here and warn me if anything happens.”

They took a few minutes to look around the neighbourhood, before Orin crossed his way to the door and knocked firmly. A few seconds went by and the door cracked open. A face appeared before swinging the door open to admit Orin and closed behind him.

Suddenly feeling very alone, Emlyn looked around rapidly for anyone who might be approaching, but the street was dead quite. If she had been dressed in her usual dresses she probably wouldn’t have lasted two seconds on the street before every brigand was after her. But disguised as boy with a sword at her side anyone who looked at her would see a mercenary, if a short one, no doubt waiting to escort their master during his shady dealings.

Funny thing Emlyn thought, that people would make such judgements based on your looks. If she had was stood here as a woman, she would be seen as easy pickings, a lamb to the slaughter. And yet, disguised as a mercenary, she didn’t reflect even a candle of her true threat. A mask on a mask. A weapon, disguised as a woman, disguised as a mercenary.

Emlyn watched from the shadows as a group of drunks heading home together, half stumbling half crawling to down the street. Their voices grew louder as they passed her, threats of violence interspersed with drunken slurs of fraternal love and raucous laughter. As they passed and voices started to disappear in the foggy night air, the door cracked open again and Orin emerged, and headed back in the direction of the inn.

“So, how did that go?” Emlyn asked as she caught up with him.

“Very well, for all parties involved. We have some very boring documents and our quartermaster will no longer be in the debt of men who break fingers.” Orin chuckled to himself. “Well, I must say, I can’t think of the last time I have had such a productive day. Let us get home before anything spoils it.

6 days to go

When Emlyn woke the sun was already well over the horizon, probably about eighth bell. She rose from her bed and washed in the basin of cold water before donning her favourite red dress and combing her hair thoroughly. This done, she added her matching butterfly hairclips to hold back her hair from falling in her face.

Leaving her room she found Orin at the desk pouring over a red book filled with numbers and figures. His glasses looked odd on him, as though he was a different person entirely. Older, more learned. Without looking up he moved his fountain pen from where it hovered over his own book of pristinely copied notes and placed it back on the table and closed the bottle of ink. 

“Breakfast?” he inquired. 

“Sounds good.” Emlyn replied, suddenly aware of how hungry she was.

They headed down to the common room and the sat down at their usual table and were approached immediately by a waiter. Orin ordered their usual breakfast.



“It is amazing how much information can be held in numbers Roise” Orin said after the waiter had retreated a sufficient distance. “Why, some would think that the fact that 2 tons of iron were shipped to a bell founder was some management slip up. I see cannons, being produced faster than the military can handle it”. 

And what would you make of a constant increase in the amount of grain being delivered to the local barracks? Or the sudden jump in gold being sent to the provinces of Kris?”

They all point to war. A war the likes of which we have never seen. And I suspect that we are not prepared. The question is, what information can we retrieve that will land a killing blow before it begins?”

“It’s going to be the Planet Drinkers isn’t it? We are going to have to neutralize them. If we have our Drinkers and they don’t have theirs, we can easily turn back their armies when the planets are in phase.”

Something about this just seemed sad to Emlyn. The Drinkers didn’t ask for any of this, they just happened to be born on the wrong side of the world, and for some reason that meant that they would have to be killed.

“If you are feeling some kind of loyalty to the Drinker of Kris, don’t” Orin said. “I understand the feeling, you both share a bond. But what about all those soldiers who are going to die on the battlefields? They are just as much human as you are, but they too are going to die because they follow the wrong King.”

Emlyn saw the logic behind Orin’s words, but it didn’t change how she felt. She did feel a connection, to all the Planet Drinkers. There was something that most people couldn’t understand. There was a pain to being born a weapon, a possession of the state. Most people could make choices; they could live their own lives. She never could.

“I will do my duty. We will do our duty” she said, with a tone somewhere between determination and resignation.

“You are young, one day you will understand the sacrifices that need to be made for the greater good” Orin said quietly, but he didn’t quite meet her eyes.

They spent the day going through the documents, Orin making notes about his suspicions and discussing his thoughts with Emlyn. Emlyn wondered to himself where whether such rampant speculation actually produced any actionable evidence. Indeed, it seemed to Emlyn, all one would have to do to ensure that your enemy surrendered immediately was to write down that you had ordered one million uniforms for your army and ensure that their spies received a copy.

But there was definitely a method to his madness, and by the time it was the fourth bell after lunch, Orin had drawn conclusions that Emlyn could not deny. Orin sat back and started on his pipe again, carefully compacting the leaf into the bowl, lighting it and pulling on the smoke smoothly.

“The question now, is what further information can we glean, now that have the first clue”, Orin said thoughtfully. “The data that we have now, is strategically valuable, plenty here about troop numbers and deployment location. But most of that will be provided by our eyes and ears in the field. One can only move a body of men so quickly, we will have that information in time to act on it no matter what. No, we need to provide The House with something further, something truly shattering”.

Orin went off into yet another one of his trances, and Emlyn figured it was best to give him some time. She pulled out her book once again, pulled both of her feet onto the chair so that she sat in a crouched position, and started to read.

There was something about history. It brought about a certain feeling of inevitability in her. When most people read a history book, they would think about all the things that once happened long ago. When Emlyn read a history book, she thought about all the things that were going to happen again in the future.

I mean, when you consider that Verris and Kris have been to war three times in the last two hundred years, how could we not be due another one after three hundred years of peace? Of course, if her mathematics tutor knew what she was thinking would have given her a very stern talking to about prior results affecting future events, but then again, Emlyn thought that Mathematicians didn’t really understand the real world.

No, this was bound to happen. And with the planets in the positions they were in now, Verris was very exposed. Legudis, the planet of the people of Kris, was coming into its most powerful phase in over a century. It provided the Planet Drinkers of Kris with unlimited agility.

Many people thought Emlyn was fast. When she kicked or punched, they swore that she simply moved her limbs from one place to the other without going through the space between. Yet, this paled in comparison to the recordings of the Planet Drinkers of Legudis. One Legudis Drinker could slit the throat of a hundred men, before one of them to could draw his blade. What good was her strength, if her enemy simply sliced her throat the second she saw them?

And if that wasn’t bad enough, Meranis was going out of phase, and would not be at its strongest again for more than two years. An attack now would be deadly. There had to be something they could do, some way to reverse the oncoming apocalypse.

Chapter Goes here.

Okay, so basically it is like this. Orin notices something. Seems like there is a huge amount of gold and steel going to the Royal Mint. But thing is, there never seems to be any coins coming out. What's up with that. Orin has a theory, but he will have to confirm.

11.
---

Under the cover of night Emlyn and Orin made their way through the fog filled streets, not quite skulking, but clearly not wanting to be seen either. 
Meranis was in perfect conjunction, directly above their heads, where the power flowed directly through her like a torrent, made all the worse by knowing that it would be slowly shrinking over the horizon as the night gave way to morning.

"Allright, let's go, Orin whispered, pointing up at the top of the tall wall surrounding the Treasury. Standing two feet away from the wall, Emlyn bent down and cupped her hands together, giving a stand for Orin to place his right foot in.

"Ready?", Emlyn asked. Orin swallowed grimly, eyes closed in silent prayer to the god's he didn't believe in before he opened them and gave a short nod.

Emlyn tapped the power of Meranis, opening herself up to the power of Meranis, allowing the the unspeakable euphoria to overtake her momentarily. She gave a massive heave with her arms and sent Orin whistling into the air. Her breath caught in her throat as she saw Orin reach his peak and begin to fall, before he landed noiselessly on the top of the wall and she began to breath again.

Soaring through the air, she glided gracefully onto the wall, landing lightly on of the crenelations and giving a little bow to Orin.

"Okay, well, then onwards we go" Emlyn replied, as Orin started to unwind the rope that he had wound around his stomach, which had anchored him to Emlyn in flight.

Orin took the rope and tied one end around the crenelation before offering the other end to Emlyn. Took the other end, wrapped it twice around her hand, and then leapt into the night.

She flew through the air lightly, perfectly pitched to carry her gracefully onto the inner keep of the Treasury.The roof rose up to meet her and she landed lightly on the copper tiles.

She let herself slip down the sloped roof until till she reached the edge and she leant her back against one of the stone gargoyles. She took her rope, pulled it taught and began to tie it firmly around the stone gargoyle. 

After checking and rechecking her knots in the dim nightlight, she gave three tugs on the taught rope and felt three tugs come back from Orin. Letting go, she rested against the Gargoyle until twenty seconds later Orin came looming out the darkness, striding arrogantly across the rope.

As he came to the top of the roof, Emlyn stretched out her hand and pulled Orin to safety.

"Excellent, now to find an entrance"

Tying another rope around the Gargoyle, Orin started to repel down the side of the building. After a brief scuffle with one of the windows, the shutter popped open and he swung inside. Emlyn waited ten seconds, before wrapping on of her legs around the rope and following.

In the dim light of the room, Emlyn looked around to survey it's contents. It seemed like some abandoned storage coset. Judging by the thick layer of dust in this room, no one had been here in quite a while. Years, perhaps decades, had come and gone, and no doubt those who had once known what was supposed to be held within had moved on, taking their secrets with them.

Endless reams of paper, ledgers and books stood in endless stacks, filling the room from wall to wall, just enoguh space remaining to walk narrowly between them to retrieve any old document. If there was any kind of system, it was a mystery to Emlyn. The faded writing gave no clue as to what their contents contained.

"Want to give this one a go?" Orin whispered, inviting Emlyn to unlock the door that would allow them access to the corridor that would take them to their objective.

Emlyn knelt down beside the door and slipped her toolset out of her bag. Peering at the lock she started to gently riggle the long metal implements, encouraging the lock to open.

There waws something very satisfying about opening locks. The finesse of it, knowing just how much pressure to use, and where. Too little and lock would not turn, too much and the lock would jam and you would have to start from the beginning again. Not much different from people really. Just a study in pressure and patience. Compliance was just a matter of time.

But this lock would not comply. Everytime she thought she was near, something odd would occur and she would be forced to start from the beginning again. And Orin's sigh's from behind weren't helping.

She tried every trick she knew, but everytime she got a little bit closer, she found something that would just not give way. Finally Orin put his hand on her shoulder and she withdrew her tools and stood back to let Orin try his luck. Although, Orin would of course say that it would only take pure skill when he did it.

While Orin drew his own set of finely crafted lock picks from his belt Emlyn wandered the room. Orin swore that he had won the lock picks from a giant in a wrestling match, or was it the present for rescuing a nobleman's wife from a band of raiding savages? There was definitely tall story behind how he came into a set of lock picks inlaid with pearl and gold. Although he no doubt stole them from some unfortunate mark or other. Irony was never lost on Orin, and he no doubt took great glee in stealing from a would be thief.

Emlyn found herself looking at the ledgers and books that stood in their towering stacks in the room. Most were the typical boring sort, reports of one lord's complaint against the other. Taxes too high, too many raiders attacking the merchant fleets, one nobleman's daughter seduced another's son and was now trying to get him to name the bastard as his heir.

Most of the reports were written in the common tounge, painstakenly copied out in smooth clear script, quill and ink engraved with expert precision. Others were written in some kind of cypher, their keys included on a loose paper between the cover and the first page. Being consigned to this room was the only action needed to ensure that they would never be read again.

The lock clicked and Orin peaked through the crack in the door.

"All clear", Orin informed her. "That lock was a real nightmare, was just about ready to ask you to smash through near the end there."

"Seems like someone predicted someone might try to do what we did", Emlyn replied, concern in her voice.

"Hardly. More likely no one ever wanted those documents read. No doubt one hundred years ago those secrets would have been most valuable. The grave has taken the men and this room has taken their secrets. Lets be on our way. Remain silent."

They snuck out into the corridor and Orin leapt off into the darkness, Emlyn following on fleet footsteps behind him. There is a trade off between speed and silence, and Orin rides the knife edge, skating along the dark stone corridors, never making more than the faintest of footsteps. 

Emlyn felt like a lumbering beast, as her quiet steps, sending thundering echoes off the bare stone walls in the labyrinthine tunnels inside the Mint.

Orin put his ear to a heavy wooden door before pulling it wide to find a winding staircase leading to the murky depths of the levels below. He turned around, winked in the dim light of the corridor and flew through the door, Emlyn following just steps behind him.

Emlyn regretted closing the door immediately, as the suffocating darkness enveloped them. Emlyn stuck her left arm to the wall while her right groped into the still air in front of her. She found Orin, their arms wrapping clumsily around each other in the pitch blackness.  Orin slipped his arm down hers until he had Emlyn's hand in his. He gave a brief squeeze of support and pulled her as he headed down the lightless stairs.

Emlyn held on tight, rushing headlong into the hellish depths, certain each step would be her last. They dashed step after step, leaving their secret entrance miles above them. Emlyn thought about the long journey that still lay ahead of her, having to travel back up the steps to make good their escape.

Finally Orin, slowed to a stop and after a brief pause said "Do you hear that?". 

Emlyn held here breath and in the deep silence, heard a faint metalic sound. Mechanical. A crashing and crunching of too many moving parts.

"The mint?" she asked, her voice bouncing off the walls in the darkness.

"Indeed" Orin replied, "Now we will what is going on here." 

Orin swung the door open slowly and quietly as the small light of the mounted torches struck their tender eyes.

"Lets go", Orin said, releasing her hand and slipping into the corridor. Emlyn followed.

12.
---

Drawn onwawrd by the ever increasing volume of the grinding machinery, they dashed through the passages in the Royal Mint. Emlyn was totally lost now. She wondered how Orin was able to keep himself oriented, trying to shut out the terrible thought that maybe he didn't.

Emlyn wasn't even really sure they were above ground anymore. They had traveled so long and so far that she wouldn't be surprised if she was in a different country entirely.

Orin waved her to a stop, and she leant against wall, trying to blend in with the shadows. Orin was leant against wall at an intersection. He poked his head out and snapped it back and fixed his gaze on Emlyn.

Two guards. Twenty yards down the corridor. Armed. Orin signed all the information she would need in a series of sharp, precise hand motions. Emlyn nodded.

Approaching a corner, Emlyn dropped into the shadow of the wall and stuck her head out to check the adjacent corridor. 

She slipped down the corridor, lump in her throat, skin tingling with excitement and pounding terror. 

Clad in bright blue uniforms with embroidered silver lining and fine swords by their sides, they appeared stood to attention beside a non-descript door. Had they not been there, she may have missed the room entirely, Emlyn thought to herself. But their presence gave away the prizes within. 

Stepping out, she took on her guise of the damsel in distress. If there was one thing all military men loved, it was having helping out an woman in need. Why, who wouldn't be thankful? And who knows how thankful she might be?

"Woah, stop right there!" the first guard yelled, stretching out his hand. "What are you doing down here?" asked the younger guard, in a friendlier tone.

"Thank goodness" Emlyn replied, putting on her most earnest voice. "I got lost, I have been wandering around for ages!"

"STOP! Not one more step, or I'll run you through!" the senior guard shouted again, putting his right hand to the hilt of his sword, as he pulled the sheath clear of his cloak with military precision. Still, the die was cast and it would take far more than two guards to dissuade her from carrying out her mission.

"Sorry", she said, almost crying, "I was just so scared".

"That's okay, but please stand right there, I'll get one of my colleagues will assist you", the guard replied, and moved his hand to put his whistle to his lips. 

She wasn't going to let him get off a summoning call, and by the time he knew to signal an alarm it would be too late.  This far below the Keep, she could feel only the tiniest shine of power from Meranis, but she had a phylactery with her that she had been charging all day. She triggered it with a tap and immediately felt the invisible glow burning on her skin. Drawing the power of Meranis into her chest, she darted forward with inhuman speed and punched straight for gut.

Winded, the soldier doubled over, trying to draw his sword, but it was too late. She whipped her knee up and felt a dull thud as her knee made contact with his head.

The impact was glancing and her fingers screamed for the wall, begging for purchase as she tried to steady herself. Her skin went icily cold and sweat burst out on her skin, her fear of death manifesting suddenly as she straightened back up to see the first guard slumped unconsciously on the floor, the younger guard staring down at him in shock. As he locked eyes with her he started backing away, his shaking hand going for his sword as well.

Emlyn almost felt sorry for him. Simply the wrong man in the wrong place at the wrong time. If he had been born in Verris he might have been someone she could have become friends with, perhaps one of the scribes or valet or any of the other young men that she would talk to in the Royal Gardens back home. She almost felt sorry for him.

She swung again, this time her left fist landing a solid contact on his forehead, his head whipping back violently into wall behind him. As he slid down the wall to join his fellow slumberer on floor, Emlyn turned, checking the corridor both ways, fearing the sound of charging guards coming to assist their friends. 

But no one came. As the adrenaline started leaving her body, her body started to shake and she crouched down taking deep breaths trying to regain her composure. With the adrenaline, the power that had been infused in her body started to fade and she started to feel her body start to ache. While, Meranis provided you with strength and alacrity, it wouldn't stop you from paying the price for your actions. She would feel the pain come tomorrow, but it could be worse, she could have been one of the soldiers.

"Nicely done. A little scrappy, but not too bad I think." Orin said, walking up to her. Emlyn just crouched, looking up at him, trying to catch her breath.

"So, we have come a long way. Shall we see what our efforts have bought us?" and Orin swung the door open.

12.
---

They entered what had once been a cavernous gallery with wooden panellig on the walls and floors betraying its once majestic designs. It had clearly once been a room once used for entertaining elegant heads of state on a tour of where their money was kept.

It had now been repurposed, the fine furniture pushed to the edges of the room, the once beautiful thick carpet sat roled up in the one of the corners.

Their eyes were drawn to the what now dominated the room. A single large metal contraption sat squarely in the middle of the room, surrounded by stacks of paper on half a dozen desks.

Approaching the desks, Orin picked up the papers and inspected them.

"Well, this trip has not been a waste." he said, passing one of the sheets to Emlyn.

"Promissory Notes?" Emlyn asked.

"Yes, specifically, Verrisian Promissory Notes. No doubt, Kris would like to use our own money to wage war against us. They cash these in, take our money and inflate our own economy at the same time. Perfect forgeries. The perfect crime".

"Perfect? When did you become an expert on forgery?"

"Well, they look real to me, and I assume that they wouldn't bother making them if they were anything less than perfect. While there are some people who will accept Promissory Notes as payment, with a quantity this big, they will need to turn most of these into one of our Royal Banks. If they can't fool the Banks, these will be worthless."

They walked around the room, inspecting the different notes, boxes of supplies and the copious amount of handwritten notes that were dashed around the place. Orin pulled up a chair at one of the desks and started reading."

"We're in trouble"

"Oh?"

"Well, judging from the amount of notes we have stacked here", he said indicating the promissory notes stood on the desks, " and the amounts they are refering to in these notes, there is a significant amount missing. The notes from the quartermaster indicated that about ten times as much paper has been delivered here and these notes concur. Some may have been lost to waste, ten or twenty percent maybe, but there should still be plenty stacked here."

"Well ther is no way we can really know how much has been received. They could have received paper from plenty of sources not on the manifest".

"Unlikely. Only a very specific type of paper can be used for Promissory Notes, and they are not sold on every market corner. No, I think that a large amount of notes have been produced and shipped out from here already."

Orin closed the ledger that he had been reading and stuck it into his bag along to join the stolen notes.

"Okay, this isn't really our job, but seeing as we are here and knocking out those guards has already given us away, Let us commit a little sabotage. And then lets go. This is enough evidence to indicate that Kris is almost certainly going to got to war with us"

Orin folded a few of the sheets and stuck them in his bag and then walked over to the giant metal contraption and started inspecting it. He bent over, looking at all it's different angles, before going back to one of the desks and picking up one fo the tools tha was neatly laid on it.

Going back to the machine, he took the tool and gave the tool a swift tap somewhere inside the machine before once more re-emerging.

"What was that?" Emyln asked?

"I made  a small mark on the stamp. Probably too small for anyone to notice it if they weren't looking for it, but should allow us to spot any more forgeries in the future."

"By the way, how did you know that the forgeries were being made on this floor?"

"Well", Orin started, "I heard... the machine".

"But its not in use at the moment, so what was it that you heard?"

"We need to go", Orin said and started to walk swiftly towards the door magnificent oak door before stopping dead  as it swung open violently. Two dozen soldiers, filed in spreading out along the wall in perfect formation, each with their hands on their swords, a look of steely determination in their eyes.

As the pair came through the door and stood on either side, a final man came through, a look of calm confidence and superiority on his face. Judgin from the insignia Emlyn put him down as the the Captain of the guard, the highest member of the Royal Body Guard. Emlynjudged him too be well into his sixties, he face aged and weathered, scarred and marked and his a hair a shock of grey, still plenty left, but clear sings of balding. 

But there was no mistaking his lethal physique. This man could take on half a dozen men half his age without breaking a sweat. And as he locked his eyes with Emlyn, she felt a icy hand of fear on her heart, freezing her in place.

"Well, well. Don't you too looked lost." The Captain said, his smile growing over his face. "So very far from home, and in the company of strangers. I don't suppose there is any chance of you coming with us without resorting to violence?"

Silence filled the room. Emlyn stared down The Captain and waited, heart hammerign in her chest, a thousand thoughts going through her mind. The fear was now starting to take her. It suddenly occured to Emlyn that she had never been truly afraid before. She had never truly confronted the thought of her own mortality, before this very second. That was a bit of an oversight really, surely some of her trainign should have dealt with her having to accept that she would one have to die. Now was really not a great time to have to come to terms with such things. 

"Rosie?" Orin said, breaking her out of her hypnosis. Cool as always, Orin stared directly ahead, never taking his eyes off the captain.

"Yeah?", she acknowledged breathlessly, the short word taking all of her will to speak, while her panic started to crash down on her like an enornomous wave in a sea of fear.

"Run".

13.
---

Orin turned on his heels and ran full tilt towards one of the doors on the other side of the room. 

"Draw swords!" The Captain shouted, and the Regiment moved in one smooth motion to bring their arms to bear.

Emlyn came out of her trance and charged after Orin, heading towards the rear wall. She could hear the men chargin after her, their heavy combat boots thundering on the floor. The sound of a loosed crossbow bolt rang through the room and Emlyn dived behind the printing press as the fletching skimmed past her cheek.

Her back to the press, she could see that Orin had almost reached door, and she knew there was no way that she could catch up with him before the soldiers were on her.

Tapping her Planet Well once more, she drew Merais into her once more, the power flowing from her necklace into her very soul. She crouched down, bracing her feet on the floor and she grabbed giant contraption in her hands.

With an enormous, wrenching determination Emlyn began to lift the press over herself. Slowly the press started to lift off the floor and into the air, the metal coffin hanging perilously over her.

Fighting it, inch by inch, she moved it into position, directly above her and she twisted violently tossing the press press directly at The Captain as she felt Miranis leave her, the Planet Well finally having run dry.

The framework flew through the air and careened over the elegant hall as Emlyn's feet went out from under her, the force of throwing the press tossing her in the direction. Airborn, she felt herself hurtling towards Orin, she grinned as she saw the look of disbelief of the soldiers faces.

The contraption thundered into the floor, a deafening crash bursting through the room. Emlyn could see soldiers, flung into the air as the press careened across the room, sliding at high speed towards the main doors leaving inch deep gouges into the beautfifully laid timbers.

Emlyn passed through open door, still airborn, and flew past Orin as she fianlly hit the floor, rolling over backwards, the world rotating in front of her eyes, before she found her feet, still sliding backwards from her momentum.

"Nice", Orin said, breathlessly as he continued through the immaculate state room towards the next door, Emlyn hot on his heels.

"We gotta get outside" Emlyn gasped "My Planet Well is dry."

"Third floor" Orin replied, "Down" he indicated.

Whipping her head aroud, Emlyn saw half a dozen soldiers chasing after them, swords drawn, one room behind. "Go!" she shouted.

The dashed through room after room in one long gallery, each room beautifully decorated, hanging art on the walls, exquisite chandleries lighting the rooms. Door after door they charged through, the soldiers following hot on their heels.

Emlyn's legs ached, her lngs were on fire and she felt as though her heart was about burst. They were hardly even running any more, stuck somewhere between jogging and walking fast, their breathing heavy as they tried to keep ahead of their persuers, who were in the same state.

Looking wildly for a window or a staircase they kept on limping forward. How big is this building Emlyn asked herself, there is no way they couldn't be out yet.

And just then Orin dashed through the next room and came out to a broad stone staircase leading down to the atrium at the front of the Mint. Giant stone statues stood in the atrium, men riding tigers and snakes locked in combat. And between, them stood another dozen soldiers, guarding the exit.

Emlyn could feel the whispers of Meranis through the giant plate windows, but they must have been facing south, as she could not pull on her power. She needed to get outside, but would be sliced to pieces before she got to the door. Which is almost certainly locked, she thought.

"What now?" Emlyn asked, her panic once again rising, the adrenaline starting to grip her body in spasms. The guards in front of the them drew their swords and started to advance, and Emlyn heard the guards behind them catching up.

"You catch me" Orin replied, and pointing to Emlyn's right along the walkway he whispered "The window".

Without thinking Emlyn sprinted towards the window, her body once again in agony, she willed her body to give it everything she had and burst through the glass. She raised her arms to take protect her face, and felt the glass slice at her, agony gripping her forearms as she dived into the cool night air.

Suddenly she felt Meranis' Power and drew on it once more. Ecstasy filled her, her pain disappearing into the abyss of euphoria that the Power covered her in. 

The ground rushed to her and she rolled to get her feet under her as she thundered into the ground, the air being pushed out of her lungs by her collision with the courtyard. Emlyn rolled to lessen the impact and looked up at the window she had just dived through to see Orin's siloutte diving through the window, his legs flailing in the air as two crossbow bolts flew out the window over his head.

Emlyn ran towards him and tried to predict where he would fall. As Orin careened through the night Emlyn braced herself once again for impact. as Orin pinwheeled downward Emlyn threw her arms open and caught him around the chest as he flew towards the hard stone.

The impact hit her like a chargin cavalry horse, as she was once again knoecked off her feet, careenning over the dull paving stones gripping Orin tightly as she could. As the world rotated around her she could hear the front doors of The Mint open and the soldiers poured out into the courtyard to try and surround them.

"Okay?" Emlyn asked as she disentangled herself from Orin, who gave a short nod, a graven look on his face.

"Time to fly again" she said, and bent down to give him another boost over the walls. Shaking, he placed his foot in her hands and she sent him flying into the air and onto the wall.

The soldiers charged at her, inhuman words, growls and screams spilling from their mouths. Their swords caught brilliant reflections of the moon in their polished steel. And Emlyn saw the hate in their eyes.

She bent down into a crouch and kicked off violently, evading their swords and rocketing to the top of the wall. Too much. She knew it immediately, she had used to much power, she would go sailing right over the wall. 

Time seemed to slow to a crawl, she saw the wall flying past her face, before it gave way to crenelations and then nothing but air. As she reached the peak of her jump, she looked down saw the concrete courtyard below, the soldiers all staring up at her, disbelieving. 

Under any normal circumstances she would be fine, well she would live, if she could just land on her feet in the street, but after all that she had been through tonight, she wasn't so sure anymore.

Suddenly a rope shot past her face, and she instinctively, grabbed at it and pulled.

Emlyn felt herself, getting pulled in towards the wall, when suddenly she saw Orin shooting towards her, pulled bodily off his feet by the strength of the her pull. Without thinking, she curled into a tight ball and felt Orin shoot over her head, the two of them in some kind of bizarre airborne dance, Emlyn open herself up for the landing and made a firm landing on the top of the wall, her feet looking for purchase on the dry stone.

Orin. It was a single thought, violent and urgent. His brief flight brought by pulling his rope was coming to an end he began once again to fall. Emlyn, coiled the rope in around her with a panicked urgency.

The rope became taught with about ten feet between her and orin as he went hurtling past her, in a determined silence from a man who had every reason to be screaming at the top of his lungs.

The pressure on the rope suddenly increased like the kick of a bull, the roped snapped taught, Shocking Emlyn's body, causing her to grit her teeth, as she took Orin's full weight. Planet Drinker or not, she still had the same weight, and Orin was far heavier than her. Momentum was not in her favour here.

Everything went quiet and Emlyn held her breath, straining against the rope. She looked both ways along the wall, expecting guards to come running, surely they had made too much noise.

But when no one came, Emlyn started to pull on the rope and inch by inch she lifted Orin back up, until finally his arm came over the side of the wall and he rolled over and they both collapsed onto the cold hard stone.

The charge of footsteps cam ethundering over the walls as guards closed on their position and Emlyn and Orin picked up their tired bodies and pushed themselves to the limit.

"Get the rope", Orin yelled throwing her a spare coil, and Emlyn started tying it around the crenellations, while Orin projected his throwing knives into the darkness, where Emlyn could hear the screams indicating they had made contact.

"Done", Emln yelled as she threw herself over the wall and started to bounce down the wall to the bottom. Looking up, she saw Orin swing over the wall as well and they both dropped to the  street outside.

As they dissapeared into a dark alley, Emlyn heard the front gate open and the cries of soldiers in the night. They limped through the alleys, changing direction at random until they came out at another main road.

And then Emlyn heard the bark of the hounds.

"Noo..." Emlyn moaned, as Orin grabbed her arm and pulled her onward.

14.
---

Orin threw his last knife and the dog went scittering to the ground, a yelp of pain escaping its throat. "I'm out" Orin gasped.

"Me too" Emlyn whimpered. "And I don't have the strength for another fight. I am drawing on Meranis just to walk. If I lose her again, I am going to collapse."

"Just keep going" Orin coaxed. "We are almost out. Go"

They limped onwards, through the maze of dingy streets and dark alleys. Everything hurt, Emlyn was in complete agony. Just moving one leg in front of the other took a monumental force of will. 

Emlyn could smell the ocean. They must be near the port, the salty air called for freedom, they were far away from their persuers now. With the final dog slain, surely there was no way that anyone could find them now.

"Dead end" Orin whispered, turning his back on the brick wall forbidding their way at the end of the narrow passage.  Emlyn turned and spotted the dark siloutte looming at the mouth of the road, blocking their way.

A whistle rang clear in the night sky and The Captain walked into the light, summoning his beleagured troops to assist him.

"Go Rosie. To the roof. I will meet you at the home."

"What?" Emlyn asked.

"Trust me. I can handle them, but you have to go. Now! GO!" Orin yelled. 

Emlyn turned and knelt, and kicked off. She stared down as she once again took to the air. Orin was looking up at her, and she felt as sense of doom overcoming her.

The fatigue wracked her body as she fell to the roof. Forcing herself back to her feet, she stared into the alley below and watched as Orin began to fight his way to safety.

Except, he didn't. Orin was knealt down, hands on his knees in sumbission, while The Captain approached him with two soldiers flanking him.

"A Planet Drinker? Not something a man such as I gets to see everyday." I am going to enjoy tracking her down."

Orin sat, completely passive, staring The Captain down. Emlyn could see that his breath was calm, face composed, resigned to his fate.

"Not going to run anymore? Not gonna fight?"

Emlyn froze. She had never thoughth that this would happen. Orin would allow himself to get captured, requiring that he be taken to a holding cell in some dark corner of the city dungeons.

Orin knew too much to be captured. He had probably already taken the poison which would be coursing through his veins. He would be able to distract them just enough to allow her to get away, but he would pass away during the night.

And Emlyn knew what she should do and what she must do. 
Emlyn dived. 

Putting the last of her strength into one big leap, she soared down back to the street, locking onto The Captain.

"There!", The Captain screamed, pointing into at her. She heard the bolt loose from the shadows as a soldier brought his arsenal to bear.

Emlyn felt a searing white heat engulf her and she felt herself tumble through the air and she crumpled onto the cold paving stones and in a blinding light she fell unconcious.

Emlyn woke to pain and darkness blah blah blah



Random stuff
---

The chimes rang out for fifth bell. “I’m going out” Emlyn said. Orin looked up at her, locked her with his sharp stare, before saying “Okay”. 

Emlyn got up to leave, grabbed her warm coat and her bag and headed out the door.

Wow, that was easy Emlyn thought. She had been expecting a fight, Orin demanding to know where she was going, insisting that she was putting herself in way too much danger heading out to see a boy so close to nightfall. She had already rehearsed in her head telling Orin that she could take care of herslf, thank you very much, to which Orin would reply that he was perfectly aware of that, but that she might expose herself, that they would know that there was a Drinker in the city. She would then reply that after stealing the book the yesterday they probably already knew, and besides, she would be careful.

But no, Orin just let her go. That was all the more concerning. Had he already figured everything out, knew where she was going and who she was meeting? Quite possible, you didn’t become a head spymaster without being able to know things that there was no way that you could know. But then again, maybe he just trusted her. Perhaps he just believed that she would not do anything stupid. Perhaps he was expecting her to come back with a key piece of information that would be the key to their victory.

“Anngghh”, Emlyn yelled as she headed down the stairs and out of the Inn. How was it that with a single word Orin could put her so much on edge? He probably didn’t even realise that he had made her so anxious, he had probably gone straight back into his trance, plotting and scheming their way to triumph.

And she was going out to meet a boy. Oh well, Emlyn thought, the die is cast, best to just hope that the odds are in your favour, and she headed to the docks to meet Robert.

...

Emlyn spotted Robert leaning on the Harbour Wall where they had left each other the day before. He was reading a book one handed, in what he no doubt thought was a cool pose. His eyes were on his book, but he didn’t seem to absorbed in it, his eyes kept leaving the pages and scanning the market.

If there was one thing that Emlyn believed in, it was getting even. And there was no way that she was going to let Robert get away with making her jump ten foot in the air.

Of course, getting the jump on him would be difficult, the way he was leaning on the wall would make it difficult to sneak up on him. Of course, that would be a problem if she wasn’t a trained spy. This was her specialty

The first tactic a spy had, was misdirection. Everyone looks one way, you go the other. A distraction then Emlyn thought looking around. What I need is a commotion, perhaps someone shouting. That will get Robert to look in that direction and I can surprise him from the other.

But how? If she had been on a job, it wouldn’t be hard. Just tap Meranis, and snap one of the supports of a nearby stall. Next time anyone put any pressure on it, it would collapse making a thunderous noise.

But that seemed a little much for a harmless prank, and Orin would most certainly have disapproved. A spy should be able to get by on their wits, not their strength. No other spies would have that option. 

What would Orin do? Hmmm, plan b.

Suddenly, she spotted something out of the corner of her eye. Or to be precise, someone. Stood in the center of the market was a group of four soldiers. 

The guard that she had confronted yesterday at the King's procession, was stood in center, jumping up and down, gesticulating wildly, while the other gaurds hunched over, holding their bellies as they rolled with laughter. 

A plan sprung into Emlyn's mind fully formed. If there was something, that Emlyn loved, it was dispensing justice. And if there was a way that doing so would help create a distraction, all the better.

Emlyn walked around the market for a bit before finding what she was looking for. The store was crawling, a menagerie of exotic animals from every corner of the world.

Foxes and badgers, snakes and peacocks. There were so many animals, Emlyn wondered how the man made any profit with the amount that he must have to feed them. Then again, none of them looked too plump, chances are he wasn't spending too much on their upkeep.

"A Pyrenian cat my lady! There truly is no better animal for a woman of high standing to posess. Look, at it's most beautiful and smooth fur, a finer speciman you will not find this side of the Delian Sea!"

The merhchant's patter broke over Emlyn like a wall of water against a sand castle, and it was all she could to raise her hand and try and cut in when he took a breath after what seemed like an extraordinarily long time.

"Please sir, I am not looking to buy a new pet". The man's face fell, the sheer look of disappointment on his face would put you in mind that she had just informed him that his wife had just died. Just before he looked like he was about to start crying Emlyn added, "But I was looking for some food for my current pet, a Rogap Adder!"

The merchant's eyebrows shot up, disappearing into his mess of black hair sitting beneath his wide purple hat. "That is quite a pet for such a young noblewoman! You must truly have the bravery of twenty men!"

"You flatter me sir, but truly, do you have any mice or small birds that I might purchase?"

The merchant, started shuffling behind the counter, moving boxes and cages, searching and rummaging until finally he brought out a small wooden enclosure, crawling with mice.

"Here we go Miss, half a crown, and there are ten plump mice in there"

Emlyn only needed the one, but she figured that it would be a little akward asking, how would she carry it he would ask, surely our snake needs more than one mouse to stay well fed? She paid up and thanked the merchant. As she headed away she heard as another hapless passerby received the full pitch.

Emlyn walked around the outside of the market, until she spotted some begger children, playing in near the wall of one of the surrounding buildings.

As she approached, they started to look nervous, but before they could bolt, she made a placating gesture and held a copper piece between her thumb and forefinger. They all stodd stock still.

"Can you do something for me?" Emlyn said, throwing the copper coin to the nearest child, he caught it in his fist, and the other surrounding him tried to prize it him but he stood firm and after a brief tussle they let go and looked back towards her.

"Wha' for?" the taller one on the left asked, his street accent making grating against Emlyn's ears.

"I need a very brave man, to take one of these mice", she said holding up the cage in her left hand, "and drop it down the trousers of that soldier over there", she said, pointing the cage at the guard, who was now stood in the circle, somewhat more refined.

"Wha'? Are you soft lady? He'll run us through if he catches us", he replied. Emlyn was about to try her own sad face on the boys, before the one on the right said, "I'll do i' for a silver".

"We have a winner!", Emlyn said, a huge smile breaking across her face. "Now you know which one it has to be right?"

"The tall ugly stupid one, thinks he's a duck"

Emlyn smiled and handed over the cage and a silver piece. After explaining that she wanted him to wait two minutes, she walked back into the market. The boys squealed to themselves as she left, their excited voices raising to a fever pitch as one of the boys pulled a mouse out by it's tail and cupped it in his hands.


Emlyn took her place mingling with the crowd  near the sea wall, so that Robert was between her and the guard. Her heart hammered as she waited, anticipating the time when she would strike.

And with the volume of a battery cannon's a scream went out among the market. All heads turned in one synchronous movement to stare at the soldier, once again hopping up and down, but now with the look of absolute fury on his face and a look of puzzlement on the faces of his friends.

Robert looked up sharply from his book and stared at the commotion going on in the market. Arms were waving and peope were shouting. It seemed as though a fight was about to break out and everyone was going to have their piece to say about it.

Looking casual, Emlyn walked along the wall slowly, until she was just a foot away two feet away from Robert and suddenly darted forward and grabbed him by his waist with a jerk.

"Aaaahhh!", Robert screamed, jumping off his feet, his book falling to the dirt in front of him. He turned, a bewildered look on his face, before a relief flooded into his face as he saw Emlyn grinning back at him.

"We're even now", she said, giving him her biggest smile. 
"Yeah", he gasped, still trying to get his breath back. "I guess we are", he finally decided, bending down to pick up his book, dusting off the jacket and inspecting it for damage.

"So... I'm here", Emlyn inquired, suddenly feeling a bit nervous that she had perhaps gone a little bit hard on him. After all he han't meant to scare her, it seemed a little cruel to punish him for that.

But it was done, and she didn't think that an apology at this stage would help. 

"You're late!" he said, a certain level of sarcasm in his tone, but Emlyn suspected he was actually quite annoyed at her tardiness.

"You wouldn't believe what I had to do before I made it here. There were mice and everything", she said jestingly.

"Right...", he replied, not quite sure what to make of that excuse.

Robert continued, "I was thinking thinking, that you being such a avid fn of history I might give you an opportunity that most could never get. A look inside the Royal Archives of Ren"

"Wow! Old books! You sure know how to show a girl a good time" Emlyn responded, crossing her arms across her chest, trying to keep a smile off her face.

"Well, err, I", Robert started before  Emlyn broke into laughter.

"Sorry, I would love to see the archives. I just don't think any guy has ever tried to taking me to a library on a first date"
Right. Well, there is a first time for everything, shall we?

...

The university loomed it's massive door flanked by two beautiful statues of philosphers long dead. The onrate doors and decorative pillars gave a asense of majesty to an otherwise hideous grey square of a building.
Reaching the top of the stops, they entered via a revolving door, all wood and glass and bronze.

"Back so soon Master Robert? Judging by your fine clothes and look of purpose we thought it was certain you were on your wy to a date with..."

The doorman fell silent as Emlyn join Robert's side.

"Destiny?", Emlyn offered, as Robert gave her a light nudge with his elbow.

"Let me introduce my friend Rosie, Rosie, this is NAME, the best friend of any student who gets a sudden need to read in the middle of the night.

Name smiled openly. "Well, it is good to see that you have interests other than reading books Master Robert." He turned a revolding wooden platform around to point it a Emlyn before asking, "Would the lady like to sign in?" 

"So this is the University?" Emyln asked, taking up the fountain pen and signing her endlessly practised alias in one smooth motion.

"Goodness no, this is only the Universities' Library, The Royal Archive to use it's full title.

Emlyn had know about the famous Royal Archive of Ren of couse, but somehow she hasd expected something... Else. Perhaps more monks, people shuffling around, ordering people to be quiet.

...

No time to finish this, but the fact is I hate this. There is something incredibly unbelievable about all this. Seriously, they seem to like each other far too much too soon. I think I have a better solution.

At the end of their first meeting, Robert doesn't ask to see her again. The whole previous chapter never occurs. Instead, he is completely forgotten, life goes on.

We continue on with the major mission, some cool shit happens. Eventually they have an epic fight with something/someone. After the action, Emlyn and Orin get into a major fight about what happened, perhaps Orin told her to do something, but she found a better way of doing it and he is angry at her for not following his orders, being risky blah blah, and she is angry at him for not giving her recognition for what she did, getting them out of a tight spot.

Anyway, she storms out, and completely by accident bumps into Robert again, they get drinks, talk late into the night and she stumbles back home drunk blah blah. Obviosuly this doesn't help matters, and she starts seeing Robert more often, and Orin doesn't like it but can't really do anything about it.

...

Notes
---

Those who drink the power of Meranis gain strength and speed.  It's said that Meran himself, with the planet at its zenith, lifted a fully manned warship out of the Strait of Kormon and hurled it ten miles. While such a story seems unlikely, there is no doubt that the ruined carcass of a centuries old iron ship still lies in the desert an hours ride from Kormon city.

Emlyn had never thrown a ship, but she had lived most of her life aware of the invisible burn of Meranis on her skin, and its power had saved her life more than once.  To be away from that shining was to be vulnerable, to be weak.  Of course, sometimes there was nothing that could be done. Once the planet sank below the horizon, only the few who had charged Planet Wells could feel the shine and the power.  The drinkers of planets further away, Persanis and Orthanis sometimes went mad when their strength disappeared below the horizon, unable to escape the knoweldge that it would not rise again in their lifetimes. 

Peeps
--

Who is Robert? Who the fuck cares? I think he is probably a rather boring person at the end of the day, nothing more than he appears. A student who is not particularly interesting, but is a nice distraction at the moment. There is of course the possiblity that he will become a spy for the enemy but I actually have a better idea. Why doesn't he fall madly in love with Emlyn? Emlyn kind of feels something, but hey, nothing is really going to last, she has to go home anyway, she knows that, why get attached. Then again, she thinks maybe she does like him, but who knows. Anyway, they hang outa  bit, but eventually it comes to a point where she get's the opportunity to totally fuck him over to get strategic advantage of some kind. I dunno, maybe get him to get documents from the archive he shouldent

Fuck yes. This  is so good.

So like, the historical records of Drinkers are kept deep within the archives, she turns Robert to get them for her. She then flees town with the intel, and totally leaves him behind to take the wrap. Torture, improsonment etc. Of course, 4/5 books later, he comes back, With A Vengance!

Plot
---

So yeah

We start with Emlyn being captured. Flash back the rest of the book, with a few flash forwards here and there to remind us where we are.

SEmlyn and Orin start with setting up their spy network, turning people, getting documents, getting contacts.

Emlyn meets Robert. They hang out a bit, I am thinking a 3 or 4 scenes on the close up, with the implication that they are meeting every few days to hang out or whatever.

I tihnk it is going to come down quite heavily to Emlyn and Orin tracking down leads on the Drinkers that Ren has at their disposal. 

I think the basic question is going to come down to try and tracking down where they are situated, so tha they can send in some assasins.

So, lets think, what is it that we need? First, we need Orin to find some kind of clue for Orin to find in the records, which will give a hint for where there might be a Drinker. This clue will elad to further investigation, but in the end it will appear that Robert has the ability to find out what is actually going on. This seems a little implausible, but not overly so. I tihnk it is within the realms of possibility that Rob will have access to "The Archives"

So what, does Orin find? Perhaps something that Drinkres need?

Interesting idea: Book two, we get introduced to a character, feamle, older, married, both members of the House. Anyway, she has an assigned animal, who is sentient during the book. In book 3 character dies, animal gets assigned to emlyn to look after. Animal regains sentience in 4th books and has to deal with the loss of previous "owner".
