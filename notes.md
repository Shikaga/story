The chimes rang out for fifth bell. "I'm going out" Emlyn said. Orin looked up at her, locked her with his sharp stare, before saying "Okay". 

Emlyn got up to leave, grabbed her warm coat and her bag and headed out the door.

Wow, that was easy Emlyn thought. She had been expecting a fight, Orin demanding to know where she was going, insisting that she was putting herself in way too much danger heading out to see a boy so close to nightfall. She had already rehearsed in her head telling Orin that she could take care of herslf, thank you very much, to which Orin would reply that he was perfectly aware of that, but that she might expose herself, that they would know that there was a Drinker in the city. She would then reply that after stealing the book the yesterday they probably already knew, and besides, she would be careful.

But no, Orin just let her go. That was all the more concerning. Had he already figured everything out, knew where she was going and who she was meeting? Quite possible, you didn't become a head spymaster without being able to know things that there was no way that you could know. But then again, maybe he just trusted her. Perhaps he just believed that she would not do anything stupid. Perhaps he was expecting her to come back with a key piece of information that would be the key to their victory.

"Anngghh", Emlyn yelled as she headed down the stairs and out of the Inn. How was it that with a single word Orin could put her so much on edge? He probably didn't even realise that he had made her so anxious, he had probably gone straight back into his trance, plotting and scheming their way to triumph.

And she was going out to meet a boy. Oh well, Emlyn thought, the die is cast, best to just hope that the odds are in your favour, and she headed to the docks to meet Robert.

...

Emlyn spotted Robert leaning on the Harbour Wall where they had left each other the day before. He was reading a book one handed, in what he no doubt thought was a cool pose. His eyes were on his book, but he didn't seem to absorbed in it, his eyes kept leaving the pages and scanning the market.

If there was one thing that Emlyn believed in, it was getting even. And there was no way that she was going to let Robert get away with making her jump ten foot in the air.

Of course, getting the jump on him would be difficult, the way he was leaning on the wall would make it difficult to sneak up on him. Of course, that would be a problem if she wasn't a trained spy. This was her specialty

The first tactic a spy had, was misdirection. Everyone looks one way, you go the other. A distraction then Emlyn thought looking around. What I need is a commotion, perhaps someone shouting. That will get Robert to look in that direction and I can surprise him from the other.

But how? If she had been on a job, it wouldn't be hard. Just tap Meranis, and snap one of the supports of a nearby stall. Next time anyone put any pressure on it, it would collapse making a thunderous noise.

But that seemed a little much for a harmless prank, and Orin would most certainly have disapproved. A spy should be able to get by on their wits, not their strength. No other spies would have that option. 

What would Orin do? Hmmm, plan b.

Suddenly, she spotted something out of the corner of her eye. Or to be precise, someone. Stood in the center of the market was a group of four soldiers. 

The guard that she had confronted yesterday at the King's procession, was stood in center, jumping up and down, gesticulating wildly, while the other gaurds hunched over, holding their bellies as they rolled with laughter. 

A plan sprung into Emlyn's mind fully formed. If there was something, that Emlyn loved, it was dispensing justice. And if there was a way that doing so would help create a distraction, all the better.

Emlyn walked around the market for a bit before finding what she was looking for. The store was crawling, a menagerie of exotic animals from every corner of the world.

Foxes and badgers, snakes and peacocks. There were so many animals, Emlyn wondered how the man made any profit with the amount that he must have to feed them. Then again, none of them looked too plump, chances are he wasn't spending too much on their upkeep.

"A Pyrenian cat my lady! There truly is no better animal for a woman of high standing to posess. Look, at it's most beautiful and smooth fur, a finer speciman you will not find this side of the Delian Sea!"

The merhchant's patter broke over Emlyn like a wall of water against a sand castle, and it was all she could to raise her hand and try and cut in when he took a breath after what seemed like an extraordinarily long time.

"Please sir, I am not looking to buy a new pet". The man's face fell, the sheer look of disappointment on his face would put you in mind that she had just informed him that his wife had just died. Just before he looked like he was about to start crying Emlyn added, "But I was looking for some food for my current pet, a Rogap Adder!"

The merchant's eyebrows shot up, disappearing into his mess of black hair sitting beneath his wide purple hat. "That is quite a pet for such a young noblewoman! You must truly have the bravery of twenty men!"

"You flatter me sir, but truly, do you have any mice or small birds that I might purchase?"

The merchant, started shuffling behind the counter, moving boxes and cages, searching and rummaging until finally he brought out a small wooden enclosure, crawling with mice.

"Here we go Miss, half a crown, and there are ten plump mice in there"

Emlyn only needed the one, but she figured that it would be a little akward asking, how would she carry it he would ask, surely our snake needs more than one mouse to stay well fed? She paid up and thanked the merchant. As she headed away she heard as another hapless passerby received the full pitch.

Emlyn walked around the outside of the market, until she spotted some begger children, playing in near the wall of one of the surrounding buildings.

As she approached, they started to look nervous, but before they could bolt, she made a placating gesture and held a copper piece between her thumb and forefinger. They all stodd stock still.

"Can you do something for me?" Emlyn said, throwing the copper coin to the nearest child, he caught it in his fist, and the other surrounding him tried to prize it him but he stood firm and after a brief tussle they let go and looked back towards her.

"Wha' for?" the taller one on the left asked, his street accent making grating against Emlyn's ears.

"I need a very brave man, to take one of these mice", she said holding up the cage in her left hand, "and drop it down the trousers of that soldier over there", she said, pointing the cage at the guard, who was now stood in the circle, somewhat more refined.

"Wha'? Are you soft lady? He'll run us through if he catches us", he replied. Emlyn was about to try her own sad face on the boys, before the one on the right said, "I'll do i' for a silver".

"We have a winner!", Emlyn said, a huge smile breaking across her face. "Now you know which one it has to be right?"

"The tall ugly stupid one, thinks he's a duck"

Emlyn smiled and handed over the cage and a silver piece. After explaining that she wanted him to wait two minutes, she walked back into the market. The boys squealed to themselves as she left, their excited voices raising to a fever pitch as one of the boys pulled a mouse out by it's tail and cupped it in his hands.


Emlyn took her place mingling with the crowd  near the sea wall, so that Robert was between her and the guard. Her heart hammered as she waited, anticipating the time when she would strike.

And with the volume of a battery cannon's a scream went out among the market. All heads turned in one synchronous movement to stare at the soldier, once again hopping up and down, but now with the look of absolute fury on his face and a look of puzzlement on the faces of his friends.

Robert looked up sharply from his book and stared at the commotion going on in the market. Arms were waving and peope were shouting. It seemed as though a fight was about to break out and everyone was going to have their piece to say about it.

Looking casual, Emlyn walked along the wall slowly, until she was just a foot away two feet away from Robert and suddenly darted forward and grabbed him by his waist with a jerk.

"Aaaahhh!", Robert screamed, jumping off his feet, his book falling to the dirt in front of him. He turned, a bewildered look on his face, before a relief flooded into his face as he saw Emlyn grinning back at him.

"We're even now", she said, giving him her biggest smile. 
"Yeah", he gasped, still trying to get his breath back. "I guess we are", he finally decided, bending down to pick up his book, dusting off the jacket and inspecting it for damage.

"So... I'm here", Emlyn inquired, suddenly feeling a bit nervous that she had perhaps gone a little bit hard on him. After all he han't meant to scare her, it seemed a little cruel to punish him for that.

But it was done, and she didn't think that an apology at this stage would help. 

"You're late!" he said, a certain level of sarcasm in his tone, but Emlyn suspected he was actually quite annoyed at her tardiness.

"You wouldn't believe what I had to do before I made it here. There were mice and everything", she said jestingly.

"Right...", he replied, not quite sure what to make of that excuse.

Robert continued, "I was thinking thinking, that you being such a avid fn of history I might give you an opportunity that most could never get. A look inside the Royal Archives of Ren"

"Wow! Old books! You sure know how to show a girl a good time" Emlyn responded, crossing her arms across her chest, trying to keep a smile off her face.

"Well, err, I", Robert started before  Emlyn broke into laughter.

"Sorry, I would love to see the archives. I just don't think any guy has ever tried to taking me to a library on a first date"
Right. Well, there is a first time for everything, shall we?

...

The university loomed it's massive door flanked by two beautiful statues of philosphers long dead. The onrate doors and decorative pillars gave a asense of majesty to an otherwise hideous grey square of a building.
Reaching the top of the stops, they entered via a revolving door, all wood and glass and bronze.

"Back so soon Master Robert? Judging by your fine clothes and look of purpose we thought it was certain you were on your wy to a date with..."

The doorman fell silent as Emlyn join Robert's side.

"Destiny?", Emlyn offered, as Robert gave her a light nudge with his elbow.

"Let me introduce my friend Rosie, Rosie, this is NAME, the best friend of any student who gets a sudden need to read in the middle of the night.

Name smiled openly. "Well, it is good to see that you have interests other than reading books Master Robert." He turned a revolding wooden platform around to point it a Emlyn before asking, "Would the lady like to sign in?" 

"So this is the University?" Emyln asked, taking up the fountain pen and signing her endlessly practised alias in one smooth motion.

"Goodness no, this is only the Universities' Library, The Royal Archive to use it's full title.

Emlyn had know about the famous Royal Archive of Ren of couse, but somehow she hasd expected something... Else. Perhaps more monks, people shuffling around, ordering people to be quiet.

...

No time to finish this, but the fact is I hate this. There is something incredibly unbelievable about all this. Seriously, they seem to like each other far too much too soon. I think I have a better solution.

At the end of their first meeting, Robert doesn't ask to see her again. The whole previous chapter never occurs. Instead, he is completely forgotten, life goes on.

We continue on with the major mission, some cool shit happens. Eventually they have an epic fight with something/someone. After the action, Emlyn and Orin get into a major fight about what happened, perhaps Orin told her to do something, but she found a better way of doing it and he is angry at her for not following his orders, being risky blah blah, and she is angry at him for not giving her recognition for what she did, getting them out of a tight spot.

Anyway, she storms out, and completely by accident bumps into Robert again, they get drinks, talk late into the night and she stumbles back home drunk blah blah. Obviosuly this doesn't help matters, and she starts seeing Robert more often, and Orin doesn't like it but can't really do anything about it.

Notes
---

Those who drink the power of Meranis gain strength and speed.  It's said that Meran himself, with the planet at its zenith, lifted a fully manned warship out of the Strait of Kormon and hurled it ten miles. While such a story seems unlikely, there is no doubt that the ruined carcass of a centuries old iron ship still lies in the desert an hours ride from Kormon city.

Emlyn had never thrown a ship, but she had lived most of her life aware of the invisible burn of Meranis on her skin, and its power had saved her life more than once.  To be away from that shining was to be vulnerable, to be weak.  Of course, sometimes there was nothing that could be done. Once the planet sank below the horizon, only the few who had charged Planet Wells could feel the shine and the power.  The drinkers of planets further away, Persanis and Orthanis sometimes went mad when their strength disappeared below the horizon, unable to escape the knoweldge that it would not rise again in their lifetimes. 

Peeps

Who is Robert? Who the fuck cares? I think he is probably a rather boring person at the end of the day, nothing more than he appears. A student who is not particularly interesting, but is a nice distraction at the moment. There is of course the possiblity that he will become a spy for the enemy but I actually have a better idea. Why doesn't he fall madly in love with Emlyn? Emlyn kind of feels something, but hey, nothing is really going to last, she has to go home anyway, she knows that, why get attached. Then again, she thinks maybe she does like him, but who knows. Anyway, they hang outa  bit, but eventually it comes to a point where she get's the opportunity to totally fuck him over to get strategic advantage of some kind. I dunno, maybe get him to get documents from the archive he shouldent

Fuck yes. This  is so good.

So like, the historical records of Drinkers are kept deep within the archives, she turns Robert to get them for her. She then flees town with the intel, and totally leaves him behind to take the wrap. Torture, improsonment etc. Of course, 4/5 books later, he comes back, With A Vengance!

Plot
---

So yeah

We start with Emlyn being captured. Flash back the rest of the book, with a few flash forwards here and there to remind us where we are.

SEmlyn and Orin start with setting up their spy network, turning people, getting documents, getting contacts.

Emlyn meets Robert. They hang out a bit, I am thinking a 3 or 4 scenes on the close up, with the implication that they are meeting every few days to hang out or whatever.

I tihnk it is going to come down quite heavily to Emlyn and Orin tracking down leads on the Drinkers that Ren has at their disposal. 

I think the basic question is going to come down to try and tracking down where they are situated, so tha they can send in some assasins.

So, lets think, what is it that we need? First, we need Orin to find some kind of clue for Orin to find in the records, which will give a hint for where there might be a Drinker. This clue will elad to further investigation, but in the end it will appear that Robert has the ability to find out what is actually going on. This seems a little implausible, but not overly so. I tihnk it is within the realms of possibility that Rob will have access to "The Archives"

So what, does Orin find? Perhaps something that Drinkres need?

Interesting idea: Book two, we get introduced to a character, feamle, older, married, both members of the House. Anyway, she has an assigned animal, who is sentient during the book. In book 3 character dies, animal gets assigned to emlyn to look after. Animal regains sentience in 4th books and has to deal with the loss of previous "owner".
